\chapter[Dynamics Between Small and Large RNA\texorpdfstring{\\}{} in the Blood of Stroke Victims]{Dynamics Between Small and Large RNA in the Blood of Stroke Victims}

Stroke is a dramatic incision into bodily homeostasis and affects a multitude of organ functions, first and foremost the brain. The immediate actions upon stroke are focused in preserving as much functional tissue as possible, so as to alleviate the cognitive damages resulting from neuron death. After this initial period of few hours, longer-lasting reactions determine the health and recovery of the patient. Many of these later events are related to immunity. The greatest danger to the patient after survival of the initial period are infections, such as pneumonia, usually between one and two weeks after the infarction. Pneumonia is often facilitated by aspiration of liquids or solids when the swallowing mechanism is impaired as a consequence of the cerebral damage. However, as introduced in Section \ref{sec:intro:stroke}, stroke-related immunodepression can play a role in post-stroke survival, and has been shown to have an impact on the transcriptome of blood-borne immune cells, at least for protein coding genes. The role of short RNA transcripts, and particularly of transfer RNA fragments, is much less clear.

\section{RNA Sequencing, Differential Expression, and Descriptive Methods}

We thus opted to analyse the blood of stroke victims taken upon hospitalisation and screen it for changes in small and large RNA expression.\todo{page break?}

\begin{method}

\subsection{The PREDICT Cohort}
The patient collective for the present study was recruited from a prospective, international, multi-center study with 11 study sites in Germany and Spain, led and approved by the neurologic department of Charité Berlin (www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01079728).\cite{Hoffmann2017} The study, called PREDICT, screened 484 stroke patients for clinical attributes and conventional biomarkers, with daily measurements in the first 5 days after stroke, and a three months follow-up. From these patients, a representative cohort of 49 patients were selected for blood small RNA sequencing. 

\subsection{Clinical Parameters Collected in the PREDICT Study}
Stroke patients were assessed daily for the duration of hospitalisation, at least until four days after admission. Blood-based biomarkers that were measured at least once during this period include: \ac{hladr}, interleukins IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10, IL-10 levels after 24h \emph{in vitro} stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, \ac{lbp}, \ac{mbl}, and \ac{tnf}-$\upalpha$. Also recorded were the time between admission and the collection of the blood sample, and the \ac{mrs}. This scale is a rough categorisation of the severity of stroke, with 0 referring to no symptoms, and 6 signifying death. Scores 1-2 describe slight neurological deficits, 3 requires frequent help because of medium level deficits, 4 requires constant assistance with daily tasks, and 5 requires stationary care.

\subsection{Sample Collection, RNA Isolation, and Sequencing}
Blood was collected into RNA stabilising tubes (Tempus Blood RNA tubes, Applied Biosystems) on each day of hospitalisation, and we subjected blood samples collected on the second day to small and large RNA-sequencing. While choosing samples for sequencing we only considered samples from patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) values of 3 and below at discharge from the hospital, to exclude very severe cases of stroke, leaving n=240 relevant cases. The time from stroke occurrence to blood withdrawal varied between 0.94 to 2.63 days, with an average of 1.98 days. Blood samples from age- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls were obtained at matched circadian time from donors with ethical approvals from institutional review boards (ZenBio, North Carolina, USA).

RNA was extracted from 3 ml of whole blood of all 484 PREDICT patients using the Tempus Spin RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA, USA). RNA quality was determined by RNA gel for all samples and by Bioanalyzer 6000 (Agilent, Santa Clara CA, USA) for samples selected for RNA-sequencing, which showed high RNA quality with a median RIN of 8.8 (lowest RIN 7.9, highest RIN 9.9). We used 600 ng total RNA of 49 samples for small RNA library construction (NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA library prep set for Illumina, New England Biolabs, Ipswich MA, USA) and selected 24 out of the 49 short RNA-sequenced samples for PolyA-selected mRNA sequencing. These libraries were prepared from 1000 ng total RNA using the TruSeq RNA library preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego CA, USA) and were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform at the Hebrew University’s Center for Genomic Technologies.

\subsection{RNA Sequencing Alignment} \label{sec:stroke:alignment}
Small RNA species were aligned after quality filtering using flexbar and miRExpress 2.0, as described in Section \ref{sec:cellculture:alignment}. Additionally, to assess tRF expression, small RNA reads were aligned to the exclusive tRNA space using the MINTmap pipeline.\cite{Loher2017} Briefly, this pipeline compares short RNA sequencing reads with a collection of sequences determined to only be contained inside mature tRNAs, without confounding from the many tRNA lookalikes in the human genome, e.g., in pseudogenes. The two RNA species were united into one expression matrix containing both miRNA and tRF expression.

Large RNA species were aligned to the human transcriptome (ENSEMBL transcriptome \emph{Homo sapiens} GRCh38 release 79) using the fast dual-phase parallel inference algorithm \emph{Salmon}.\cite{Patro2017} Briefly, the method combines an »online« fragment mapping utilising continuous updating of a Bayesian prior with an »offline« phase that determines fragment quantities by application of the Bayesian model determined before via a standard expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm or a variable Bayesian EM. Additionally, the pipeline corrects for multiple typical biases in sequencing, such as position-specific biases, sequence-specific 3' and 5' end biases, fragment GC content bias, and fragment length distribution. The resulting quantified fragments were imported into R using the rsubreads package.\cite{Liao2019}

\subsection{Quality Control and Filtering}
Raw and processed reads were quality-controlled using FastQC, as described in Section \ref{sec:cellculture:sequencing}, with no samples falling below acceptable thresholds. Small and large RNA alignments were batch-corrected followed by analysis of inter-sample relationships via the method proposed by Oldham \emph{et al.} (as described in Section \ref{sec:cellculture:quality}). We excluded no large RNA samples and one small RNA sample (»11\_40044\_S12«).

\subsection{RNA Sequencing Differential Expression Analysis}
Quantified reads were subjected to differential expression analysis using DESeq2, essentially as described in Section \ref{sec:cellculture:deseq}. Small RNA species were analysed together by combing count tables for miRNAs and tRFs, large RNA were analysed separately. Both datasets were corrected for covariates \emph{subject age} and \emph{batch}. Correction for patient sex was not necessary because all patients in the final analyses were male. Log$_2$-fold changes were shrunk using \emph{apeglm} as described in Section \ref{sec:cellculture:deseq}, at an alpha level of \emph{0.1}.

\subsection{Gene Ontology Analyses}
We performed \ac{go} analyses on the set of \ac{de} transcripts, using different ranking methods. GO analyses were performed using R/topGO as described in Section \ref{sec:cellculture:topgo} using the weighted method.

\subsubsection{Ranking by P-Value}
Transcripts were ranked by p-value, and different test sets were tested against the background of the topmost two thousand transcripts. We tested the set of all \ac{de} transcripts (adjusted p-value < 0.05) and the separate sets of positively and negatively regulated transcripts. Additionally, for each test group, the criterion of log$_2$-fold changes > 1.4 was applied and re-tested.

\subsubsection{Ranking By Count-Change}
Alternatively, transcripts were ranked by count-change, and the top 100 significantly \ac{de} transcripts were tested against the background of the first two thousand transcripts. Similarly to the p-value ranking, test sets comprised all transcripts as well as only negatively or positively regulated transcripts.

\subsection{Homology Computation Among tRNA Fragments}
Transfer RNA fragment origin can be ambiguous, even in fragments derived from tRNA-exclusive space. To assess sequence-based relationships between tRFs, all detected fragments were subjected to pairwise homology analysis using local Smith-Waterman alignment (\emph{pairwiseAlignment} function of the R/Biostrings package), and scores were transformed into a distance matrix to enable clustering and visualisation of relationships. t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding) was employed to visualise tRF homologies in a 2D space.

\subsection{t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding} \label{sec:stroke:tsne}
SNE (Stochastic Neighbour Embedding) replaces Euclidian distances between data points with conditional probabilities that represent similarities. The Gaussian distribution used in SNE to represent the probability density for any given data point in the low-dimensional space is replaced by a Student's t-Distribution in the updated t-SNE algorithm. In combination with the use of a symmetrised function with simpler gradients, this alleviates problems with optimisation of the cost function that is used to create forces between points on the low-dimensional map.\cite{Maaten2008}

t-SNE was used in a variety of applications to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data, for instance, the amino acid origin of tRFs, or the association of tRFs with distinct cell types in the blood. t-SNE analyses were performed in R, using the Rtsne package.\cite{Krijthe2015} t-SNE requires, apart from the input data, a parameter called \emph{perplexity}, which determines the weighting of local as opposed to global effects in the data. So far, there are no strict rules governing the selection of a perplexity value, other than that the perplexity cannot exceed the number of individual data points. Since different perplexities can give widely varying results, which can sometimes be misleading, the resulting maps have to be screened with a range of perplexities to assess their robustness.

\subsection{Cholinergic Association of Small RNA Species} \label{sec:stroke:chol-assoc}
To determine association of distinct smRNAs with cholinergic transcripts, we analysed the multiple-targeting relationships of each distinct smRNA towards our curated list of \ac{ca} transcripts. We first created complete targeting data of all DE smRNAs towards all \ac{ca} transcripts, which we then successively filtered for multiple targeting behaviours. To assess the base level of multiple targeting of cholinergic transcripts, we utilised empirical cumulative density functions of the number of individual cholinergic targets of each miRNA and tRF (Figure \ref{fig:cholino-ecdfs}). We assumed 80\% to be a robust threshold of cholinergic targeting, and for diverging numbers between miRNAs and tRFs chose to use the higher (more stringent) threshold. smRNAs above this threshold (i.e., smRNAs targeting at least as many cholinergic transcripts as the threshold value) were considered \ac{ca}.

\end{method}

\section{Descriptive Analysis of RNA Dynamics in Blood After Stroke}

\subsection{Differential Expression of Large RNA}
At an alpha level of 0.05, we detected 694 \acf{de} long transcripts, 204 of them up- and 490 down-regulated (Figure \ref{fig:stroke-de-tsne}\,A). 18 of the up-regulated, and 109 of the down-regulated transcripts exceeded the common log$_2$-fold change threshold of 1.4. To determine the most-impacted pathways, we performed \ac{go} analyses.

\subsection{Gene Ontology Analyses of Differentially Expressed Genes} \label{sec:stroke:large-rna-go}
Ranking of all transcripts (regardless of direction of regulation) by their differential expression p-value resulted in GO terms mainly related to circulatory system processes (p = 0.018) and immunity. Most notable immune-related terms included cytokine-mediated pathways (p = \e{2.4}{-4}), response to \acp{ifn} $\upalpha$ (p = 0.013) and $\upbeta$ (p = \e{1.2}{-3}), regulation of JAK/STAT cascade (p = 0.013), response to \ac{lps} (p = 0.025), and macrophage activation (p = 0.026). Limiting the test set to transcripts with log$_2$-fold change above 1.4\,\,increased sensitivity towards immune processes, yielding lower p-values for the enrichment of of positive (\e{1.7}{-4}) and negative regulation of cytokine production (\e{5.7}{-4}), type I interferon production (\e{3.9}{-4}), response to bacterium (\e{5.9}{-4}), innate immune response (\e{2.0}{-3}), response to organophosphorous (\e{2.3}{-3}), cytoplasmatic pattern recognition receptor signalling pathway (\e{2.8}{-3}), and response to \ac{lps} (\e{9.1}{-3}).

Up-regulated transcripts pertained to circulatory system processes, such as platelet degranulation (\e{1.2}{-3}) and aggregation (0.02), and sprouting angiogenesis (\e{4.8}{-3}), but also antigen processing and presentation (\e{4.5}{-3}). Test set limitation to log$_2$-fold change above 1.4 did not increase sensitivity of those terms, but presented essentially similar results. Up-regulated genes as such might be indicative of the bodily response to blood flow disruption and ischaemia caused by the stroke. 

Down-regulated transcripts were enriched in terms involving response to \ac{ifn} $\upalpha$ (\e{1.3}{-3}) and $\upbeta$ (\e{3.1}{-4}), response to \ac{lps} (\e{1.5}{-3}), rhythmic process (\e{2.5}{-3}), positive regulation of T cell proliferation (\e{4.3}{-3}), positive regulation of JAK-STAT cascade (0.015), and cellular response to \ac{il}-1 (0.019). Test set limitation to log$_2$-fold change above 1.4 again increased sensitivity towards immune-related terms, but without changing the general pattern. Thus, down-regulated genes in all likelihood represent the post-stroke immunodepression, which can exacerbate into CIDS (see Section \ref{sec:intro:stroke}). The terms involving INF, IL-1, LPS, and JAK-STAT also indicate an important role for cytokine signalling in these processes.

As a cross-check, \ac{de} transcripts were ranked by count-change, and re-analysed. The top 100 changed transcripts, without regard to direction (absolute count-change) yielded terms implying response to \ac{ifn} $\upalpha$ (\e{3.8}{-4}), $\upbeta$ (\e{1.1}{-4}), and $\upgamma$ (\e{1.4}{-4}), mitochondrial organisation (\e{5.6}{-3}) and ATP synthesis (\e{6.9}{-3}), response to \ac{il}-4 (\e{6.9}{-3}), positive regulation of JAK-STAT cascade (\e{8.8}{-3}), response to antibiotic (0.044), and platelet degranulation (0.045). The top 100 up-regu"-la"-ted transcripts yielded terms involving platelet degranulation (\e{3.8}{-3}), mitochondrial ATP synthesis (\e{4.2}{-3}), response to xenobiotic stimulus (0.017), platelet aggregation (0.013), and response to antibiotic (0.016), while the top 100 down-regulated transcripts were associated with inflammatory response (\e{1.3}{-4}), regulation of apoptosis (\e{1.8}{-4}), cytokine secretion (\e{6.8}{-4}), antigen processing and presentation (\e{1.2}{-3}), regulation of lymphocyte apoptosis (\e{2.3}{-3}) and proliferation (\e{2.7}{-3}), response to antibiotic (\e{5.2}{-3}), leukocyte homeostasis (\e{7.6}{-3}), response to \ac{il}-1 (\e{7.6}{-3}), and many more immune-specific processes. This corroborates the previous findings, that up-regulated transcripts represent the response to circulatory system damage, and down-regulated transcripts indicate a cytokine-mediated immunodepression. For a full list of all terms from these analyses\todo{DE genes?}, see Appendix \ref{appendix:go-terms-large-rna}. 

\subsection{Differential Expression of small RNA}
In the simultaneous co-analysis of miRNAs and tRFs, we detected 420 DE miRNAs and 143 DE tRFs (adjusted p-value < 0.05, Figure \ref{fig:stroke-de-tsne}\,B\&C). 63\% of miRNAs (265) were down-regulated, while 87\% of tRFs (124) were up-regulated. tRFs were mainly derived from the 3' end (3'-tRFs, 87) or from internal tRNA regions (i-tRFs, 48), while the tRFs from 5' ends (5'-tRFs) were in the minority (6). The amino acid distribution was shifted in favour of alanine- (35), glycine- (28), and proline-carrying (12) tRNAs (Figure \ref{fig:stroke-de-tsne}\,D). 30 of the 35 alanine-associated tRFs were 3'-tRFs, and all of those were up-regulated, indicating non-random generation of these fragments.

Clear clusters can be observed for tRFs derived from tRNA carrying alanine, glycine, leucine, proline, and methionine.
\label{fig:stroke-de-tsne}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Homology Among tRNA Fragments}
Using pairwise homology among all DE tRFs, visualised via t-SNE (see Section \ref{sec:stroke:tsne}), we identified clusters of highly similar fragments, that correlate with their amino-acid origin, i.e., the amino acid which is carried by the respective parent tRNA (Figure \ref{fig:stroke-de-tsne}\,E). This relationship persisted across distinct individual tRNAs coding for the same amino acid, and was particularly pronounced in tRNAs associated with alanine, glycine, leucine, proline, and methionine.

\subsection{Cholinergic Association of Small RNA Species}
The association of smRNA species to distinct systems or pathways is not trivial because of the multiple-targeting nature of these RNAs. For the purpose of the following analyses, we define a small RNA as being associated with cholinergic processes by the positive association of the smRNA with a number of \acf{ca} large transcripts. We do not assess the question whether this small RNA also targets other systems equally, or even if it targets cholinergic transcripts with greater likelihood than a random selection of genes. For this reason, we select a fairly high threshold for the definition of a \ac{ca} smRNA, which is the targeting of at least 5 \ac{ca} transcripts (above 80\% on the empirical cumulative density function of cholinergic targeting, see Section \ref{sec:stroke:chol-assoc}).

Following this definition, we detected 52 \ac{ca} miRNAs (90\% down-regulated, 5 up and 47 down), and 18 \ac{ca} tRFs (83\% up-regulated, 15 up and 3 down). Above a threshold of log$_2$-fold change of 1.4, we found 33 \ac{ca} miRNAs (97\% down-regulated, 1 up and 32 down), and 9 \ac{ca} tRFs (78\% up-regulated, 7 up and 2 down). \ac{ca} smRNAs are marked in red in Figure \ref{fig:stroke-de-tsne}\,B\&C.\todo{amino acids?}

\section{Blood Compartments of Cholinergic Systems and Small RNA Species}
To address the shortcomings of whole-blood RNA sequencing, which is more representative of the clinical setting, but less specific regarding cellular compartments, we consulted third party datasets to assess RNA species distribution in different cellular and non-cellular compartments of the blood. For small RNA species, we re-analysed a published dataset of small \ac{seq} of 450 human samples from various blood tissues;\cite{Juzenas2017} for large RNA transcripts, we utilised the tissue specificity of Marbach's regulatory circuits.\cite{Marbach2016} The large RNA information was used to identify blood cell types with cholinergic transcriptional activity, which was then used to zoom in to small RNA expression subsets related to cholinergic processes.

\begin{method}

\subsection{Large RNA Regulatory Circuits in Tissues of the Blood}
To evaluate the cell type distribution of cholinergic genes in blood tissue types, we utilised the expression patterns derived from cumulative transcription factor activity of Marbach's regulatory circuits.\cite{Marbach2016} As shown by the authors, the cumulative activity of all transcription factors towards one gene describe well the actual expression of that gene in the respective tissue type. To maximise comparability to the parallel analyses of small RNA species (Section \ref{sec:stroke:juzenas}), blood cell types (i.e., »regulatory circuits«) were selected to reflect the cell type selection of Juzenas \emph{et al.}\cite{Juzenas2017} based on similar markers of the »cluster of differentiation« family of genes. These were: CD4-positive T-helper cells, CD8-positive cytotoxic T-cells, CD14-positive monocytes, CD15-positive neutrophils, CD19-positive B-cells, CD56-positive natural killer cells, and, for comparison, whole blood. For the sake of simplicity, genes were considered »present« in each blood tissue type if at least one TF showed activity towards the gene.

TF activities were collected for all of the tissues and aggregated across all genes by summing. The resulting table of 15\,032 genes in the seven tissues was used as input for the \emph{Rtsne} function.\cite{Krijthe2015} t-SNE was computed using a perplexity of 49 and visualised as 2D map using R/ggplot2.\cite{Wickham2016}

\subsection{An Atlas of Small RNA Expression in Cell Types of the Blood} \label{sec:stroke:juzenas}
To evaluate the cell type distribution of our small RNA molecules, we analysed a dataset deposited by Juzenas \emph{et al.},\cite{Juzenas2017} who separated and sequenced 450 samples comprising seven types of individual blood cell types (characterised by »cluster of differentiation«-type membrane-bound receptors), serum, exosomes, and whole blood. The individual blood cell types comprised CD4-positive T-helper cells, CD8-positive cytotoxic T-cells, CD14-positive monocytes, CD15-positive neutrophils, CD19-positive B-cells, CD56-positive natural killer cells, and CD235a-positive erythrocytes (the only distinct cell type not available in Marbach's regulatory circuits, since mature erythrocytes do not transcribe). Starting from the raw data deposited on NCBI GEO, we controlled the quality, applied quality based filtering, and aligned the 450 samples to miRNA and tRF sequences, as described in Section \ref{sec:stroke:alignment}. The original publication did not offer statistical analyses because of a failure in the spike-in procedure, and defined presence of a small RNA by a measure of at least five counts in 85\% of samples. However, since this definition relies heavily on sequencing depth, and depth can vary widely even in methodically robust sequencing experiments depending on a large number of variables (see Figure \ref{fig:read-quality-length}\,C), we defined our own test for descriptive analysis of presence or absence of lowly expressed small RNAs in each of the sample types:

\subsection[Definition of Presence and Absence of Lowly Expressed\texorpdfstring{\\}{} smRNA Molecules]{Definition of Presence and Absence of Lowly Expressed smRNA Molecules}
This definition comprises estimation of a log-normal distribution from a small RNA expression profile, and a statistical test to refute the null hypothesis that the distribution is in fact log-normal. The danger of evaluating true expression of lowly expressed smRNA molecules by a count-based threshold is the possibility of random reads resulting from degradation products of highly expressed RNA with similar sequence, and the amplification of noise. Both problems are exacerbated by an increase in sequencing depth. In today's \ac{seq} technology, most chips can accommodate only a limited amount of samples compared to the amount of reads that can be generated. While this is not as problematic in cases of longer inserts and paired design, which is usually employed in large \ac{seq}, in small \ac{seq} this can lead to enormous overheads of reads. It is not uncommon to receive tens of millions of reads for each sample, which exceeds the recommended amount (of at least one million) by large margins.

Thus, there is the need to distinguish between degradation products of highly expressed RNA molecules or amplified noise and legitimate lowly expressed smRNA molecules (even more so since one of the smRNA species is a product of non-random tRNA degradation). The central assumption for our proposed method is: The expression pattern of legitimate smRNA molecules follows, as is common in biology, a normal distribution of some kind, or, for the discrete case, a normal poisson distribution. On the other hand, degradation products or noise would rather follow other, »non-biological« distributions, such as a uniform distribution or a monotonously decreasing power-law distribution such as the Pareto distribution. Thus, we chose to statistically test each smRNA in each tissue type for the adherence to this criterion, by comparing the measured counts with a distribution function estimated based on the mean and standard deviation of the measured counts. During testing, we found the log-normal distribution to give the best classification results.
 
The distribution mean and standard deviation of the expression values per cell type and smRNA were estimated using the \emph{fitdist} function of the R/fitdistrplus package.\cite{Delignette-Muller2015} The count distribution was then tested against a log-normal distribution with the estimated mean and standard deviation via the R implementation of the Kolmogorov\=/Smirnov test, with a cutoff of 0.1. The small RNA was defined as present if the test failed to reject the null hypothesis (see Appendix \ref{appendix:presence-absence} for numerous examples).

\subsubsection{Analysis of Expression Patterns and Establishment of Virtual Tissues}
The distribution of smRNA expression across the different cell types was used to assign 8 functional compartments (i.e., »virtual tissues«) to the entirety of detected fragments such that each smRNA was sorted into one of the tissue classes. Ideally, these classes would be unambiguous, i.e., there would be no overlap of smRNA molecules between the classes. Eight classes were created via hierarchical clustering of miRNA and tRF expression separately (Figure \ref{fig:heatmaps-small}), and then used in combination with t-SNE applied to the entire expression matrix, to visualise the compartmentalisation of smRNAs in these virtual tissues. The samples taken from stroke patients in the PREDICT study were sequenced from whole blood, which precludes direct information about tissue distribution. Thus, the two-dimensional maps from t-SNE visualisation were used to, first, explore the tissue association of smRNAs differentially expressed in stroke patients' whole blood samples, and second, examine the potential impact of \acl{ca} smRNAs in these tissues.

\end{method}

\subsection{Large RNA Expression Patterns Identify Cholinergic Systems\\ in CD14-positive Monocytes}
The expression patterns of 15\,032 large RNA molecules in blood-borne immune cells were visualised in a t-SNE-derived 2D map (Figure \ref{fig:tsne-large}\,A). More than half of all transcripts show highest expression in whole blood (7533, not shown), so subsequent analyses were performed on the set of six tissues, without the whole blood compartment. In this set (14\,280 genes), most transcripts show highest expression in monocytes (9125 transcripts), followed by CD19-positive B-cells (1176) and neutrophils (1166). Remaining are CD4-positive T-helper cells (1092), NK-cells (948), and CD8-positive cytotoxic T-cells (773). When filtered for cholinergic genes, there is visible enrichment of core cholinergic transcripts in a spatial sub-compartment of CD14-positive monocytes (Figure \ref{fig:tsne-large}\,B). Considering the different monocyte phenotypes (pro- and anti-inflam"-ma"-to"-ry, see Section \ref{sec:intro:stroke}), and their implied transcriptomic differences, which most likely are brought on by divergent TF activity, this compartmentalisation of cholinergic transcripts inside one spatial sub-compartment might indicate a cholinergic »preference« in favour of one particular monocyte phenotype.

Genes were plotted on the first two t-SNE dimensions and coloured by the cell type of their highest expression, i.e., the highest cumulative transcriptional activity of all active TFs. \textbf{A)} Complete t-SNE shows a gradient of expression across the different cell types, with much expression in CD14-positive monocytes and T-cells. \textbf{B)} Highlighting of cholinergic core genes reveals an enrichment in close compartments of CD14-positive monocytes.

\subsection{Identification of Functional Enrichment of smRNA Expression\\ in Blood-Borne Cells}
To date, there is no comprehensive expression catalogue of smRNA species expression in the tissue types of the human body that is comparable to what has been achieved in the description of large RNA. To classify the detected smRNAs in a manner specific to tissues in human blood, we utilised a dataset published by Juzenas \emph{et al.},\cite{Juzenas2017} who describe miRNA expression in a variety of blood tissues (see Section \ref{sec:stroke:juzenas} for details). We re-analysed the publicly deposited data for miRNA and tRF expression, and developed our own method of defining »presence« of the smRNA in each tissue type based on the evaluation of a log-normal distribution model (instead of using a simple count threshold). 

Using this presence/absence data, we first utilised hierarchical clustering to establish »virtual tissues« that could be assigned to each smRNA (Figure \ref{fig:heatmaps-small}) for later evaluation in the stroke patient sequencing. Both miRNAs and tRFs showed a number of clearly associated smRNAs with several compartments, whereas other compartments and smRNAs were distributed in a more complex manner. The ten tissue types of the Juzenas \emph{et al.}\cite{Juzenas2017} study were equally parted into two five-tissue superclusters by the expression patterns of both smRNA species (Figures \ref{fig:heatmaps-small}\,A\&B, x-axis). These two clusters distinguish immune from non-immune compartments in the blood, but for one notable exception: while the »immune supercluster« comprises monocytes, T-cells, B-cells, and NK-cells, the »non-immune supercluster« contains neutrophils in addition to erythrocytes and the non-cellular tissues serum, exosomes, and whole blood. Notably, the neutrophil samples cluster closest to the whole blood compartment in both smRNA species.

Two distinct virtual tissues showed high consistency in both smRNA species: a virtual tissue containing only CD14-positive monocytes and another tissue comprising all studied cellular immune components except neutrophils (i.e., monocytes, B-cells, CD4- and CD8-positive T-cells, and NK-cells). miRNAs (Figure \ref{fig:heatmaps-small}\,A), in addition, yield clear clusters for whole blood expressed miRNAs, and for miRNAs expressed ubiquitously without exception. In tRFs (Figure \ref{fig:heatmaps-small}\,B), the general picture is more complicated, as the clusters are often mixed.

\caption[Functional Characterisation of Hierarchical Clusters in Blood Cell Small RNA Expression.]{\textbf{Functional Characterisation of Hierarchical Clusters in Blood Cell Small RNA Expression.} Information on presence/absence of miRNAs and tRFs in the tissue types analysed in Juzenas \emph{et al.}\cite{Juzenas2017} were hierarchically clustered into 8 clusters using the Ward method,\cite{Ward1963} and plotted on a heatmap (single smRNAs on the y-axis, tissue types on the x-axis). To assign meaning to these clusters, manual inspection was followed by annotation of enrichment in tissue types. Complex combinations were approximated by their most prominent features. \textbf{A)} Clusters of miRNA presence/absence in blood cell compartments. Clearest cluster association was shown by miRNAs expressed only in monocytes (»mono«), in all blood-borne immune cells except neutrophils (»immune«), ubiquitously without exception (»ubi«), and only in whole blood (i.e., in none of the single compartments (»whole-blood«). \textbf{B)} Clusters of tRF presence/absence in blood cell compartments. Clearest cluster association was shown by tRFs expressed only in monocytes (»mono«), and in all blood-borne immune cells except neutrophils (»immune«). The other tissue-related clusters were not as clear as in the miRNA expression data, indicating a looser association to cell type of tRNA-derived smRNAs.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Expression Patterns of Differentially Expressed and\\ Cholinergic-Associated smRNAs}
Similarly to the visualisation of large RNA molecules, the expression patterns of 600 miRNAs and 1671 tRFs in ten tissues of the blood were visualised in t-SNE-derived 2D maps (Figure \ref{fig:tsne-small}\,A\&B). In the initial visualisation, the forming of multiple clusters according to some virtual tissues can be observed, while other virtual tissues are visibly more dispersed. Clearest clusters are formed in both cases by ubiquitously expressed smRNAs (»ubi«), smRNAs expressed only in monocytes(»mono«), and smRNAs equally expressed in all immune-related blood-borne cells except for neutrophils (»immune«). Examination of DE smRNAs on this 2D map shows a further parallel between miRNAs and tRFs (Figure \ref{fig:tsne-small}\,C\&D): differential expression after stroke takes place in all compartments of the blood, and highest changes in transcript amount (as measured by count-change) are observed in ubiquitously expressed smRNAs. Similarly, \ac{ca} miRNAs and tRFs (Figure \ref{fig:tsne-small}\,E\&F) are observed in all compartments, but the most highly differentially regulated CA smRNAs are expressed in all blood tissues alike. Notably, whole blood does not play a role in DE miRNAs, which might indicate lower relative importance of non-cellular blood compartments in terms of classification. In other words, most smRNAs that are found in non-cellular compartments are found in the cellular compartments as well, making them irrelevant for classification (however, their biological function in these non-cellular compartments remains a matter of interest).

\section{Regulatory Circuits of Small RNA and Transcription Factors\\ in CD14-positive Monocytes}

\begin{method}

\subsection{Comprehensive Circuit Network Creation} \label{sec:stroke:circuit-network}
The comprehensive transcriptomic network in CD14-positive monocytes was created in a two-step process of \emph{miRNeo} targeting. First, the complete TF$\to$gene network was created from the targeting data derived from Marbach \emph{et al.}\cite{Marbach2016}, yielding a CD14-specific network comprising 616 TFs with activity towards 13\,447 transcripts, in 318\,731 unique interactions. Second, this network was then subjected to successive \emph{miRNeo} targeting of all transcripts in the network by miRNAs and tRFs.

For each node fulfilling an active role in this network (i.e., miRNAs, tRFs, and TFs), an activity parameter was computed. The activity of each node is hereby defined as the sum of all scores of each of its targeting relationships. In the case of miRNAs, the score is the summary score introduced in Section \ref{sec:database:mirna}, for tRFs, it is the score calculated with the BL-PCT method (see Section \ref{sec:database:trf-targeting}), and for TFs, it is the transcriptional activity given by Marbach \emph{et al.}\cite{Marbach2016} Activities were normalised, for each biotype separately, by scaling the calculated values $v$ onto a range between 0 and 1, using $$v_{i, norm} = \frac{v_i}{max(v)}$$
with $max(v)$ being the maximum of all scores in this biotype category, and all $v$ > 0. The activity of each relationship determined the weight of the edge between the two connected nodes.

The network was visualised in gephi,\cite{Jacomy2014} omitting all non-TF genes, and using ForceAtlas2 to generate a force-directed 2D map of smRNA$\to$TF interactions in CD14-positive monocytes. Network modularity was calculated using the function included in gephi, with a resolution of 2.0, to yield 2 distinct modularity classes. The module association of TFs to the tRF- and miRNA-associated modules were used to perform subsequent analyses of the distinct modules. 

\subsection[Gene Ontology Analyses of TF$\to$Gene Networks\texorpdfstring{\\}{} of CD14-positive Monocytes]{Gene Ontology Analyses of TF$\to$Gene Networks of CD14-positive Monocytes} \label{sec:stroke:go-cd14}
The TF$\to$gene networks of each of the two modules derived from smRNA species association (miRNAs versus tRFs) were analysed using topGO\cite{Alexa2006} essentially as described in Section \ref{sec:cellculture:topgo}. Genes were ordered according to the cumulative activity of TF targeting of each gene in CD14-positive monocytes. To display a range of top genes, transcript background was iterated in five equal steps from 1000 transcripts to the maximum size of target transcripts in each network (12\,927 for miRNA-targeted TFs, 12\,904 for tRF-targeted TFs). The test set was the top 10\% of transcripts for each background size. GO terms were collected and screened for multiple entries among the sets. The most prevalent terms were used to infer the functional roles of miRNA- and tRF-targeted transcription factors. We determined the overlap of GO terms between both smRNA species as well as the terms exclusive to either. 

\end{method}

\subsection{Dichotomy of Small RNA Targeting of Transcription Factors\\ in CD14-positive Monocytes}
Organisation of the smRNA$\to$TF network via a force-directed algorithm resulted in visible clustering of two distinct subnetworks, that are governed by miRNAs and tRFs, respectively (Figure \ref{fig:smrna-tf-network-fractions}). Inside this network, 10 TFs were found DE in patient blood after stroke (Figure \ref{fig:smrna-tf-network-fractions}\,A). Calculation of modularity clearly divided the network into TFs primarily influenced by miRNAs and TFs primarily influenced by tRFs (Figure \ref{fig:smrna-tf-network-fractions}\,B). Based on these two sets of TFs, two distinct TF$\to$gene networks were created: 289 miRNA-biased TFs with 152\,649 unique TF$\to$gene targeting relationships, and 280 tRF-biased TFs with 163\,641 unique TF$\to$gene targeting relationships.

\subsection{Gradual Shift in Control Over Transcription Factors\\ by miRNAs and tRFs}
Of those TFs, 356 were detected in the stroke patient blood sequencing experiment. It is notable that, although the complete graph shows clear segregation between miRNA-targeted and tRF-targeted transcripts, merely 106 of those TFs are targeted by only one of the two smRNA species (48 only by miRNAs and 58 only by tRFs), and 55 are supposedly not at all targeted by any smRNA present in CD14-positive cells. The remaining 195 TFs are putative targets of both smRNA species (Figure \ref{fig:smrna-tf-network-fractions}\,C). 

At an alpha level of 0.1 for the differential expression between stroke patients and controls, 26 of these TFs remain, also showing a gradual pattern of targeting by miRNAs and tRFs (Figure \ref{fig:smrna-tf-network-fractions}\,D). Six of these transcription factors are implicated in the control of cholinergic core or receptor genes (marked with a »C«). It is notable that a number of TFs show no indication of being a target of either smRNA species present in CD14-positive cells under the premises of this dissertation's targeting approach (Figure \ref{fig:smrna-tf-network-fractions}\,E). Considering the multiple-targeting behaviour of smRNAs, and the general experience that non-targeted genes are uncommon, this finding is interesting in itself, particularly since it involves well described regulators of immunological processes, such as \emph{STAT2} and \emph{ELF1}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/smrna-tf-network-fractions}
\caption[Small RNA Targeting of Transcription Factors in CD14-positive Monocytes.]{\textbf{Small RNA Targeting of Transcription Factors in CD14-positive Monocytes.} The two-dimensional map of all TFs active in CD14-positive monocytes and their smRNA controllers was created via \emph{miRNeo} targeting and visualisation via force-directed algorithm. Node size is determined by activity (see Section \ref{sec:stroke:circuit-network}). \textbf{A)} Nodes coloured by biotype: miRNAs - green, tRFs - purple, TFs - yellow, differentially expressed TFs: red. TFs targeted mainly by tRFs segregate visually from TFs targeted mainly by miRNAs. Both sets contain DE TFs, indicating complementary function. \textbf{B)} The network was segregated into two modules by network connectivity measures. Node colour denotes modularity class association. Network modularity largely reflects TF targeting of tRFs (orange) versus miRNAs (blue). \textbf{C)} Bar graph displays the fraction of smRNAs of each species targeting each of the TFs. A tRF fraction of 1 means all smRNAs targeting the TF are tRFs, 0 means all are miRNAs. Displayed on x axis is »tRF fraction - 0.5« to center on 50:50 targeting by both species. 48 TFs are solely targeted by miRNAs (leftmost) and 58 solely by tRFs (rightmost). \textbf{D)} Similarly, TFs differentially expressed in the blood of stroke victims show a distribution on the miRNA-tRF gradient. Point size denotes count-change, point color denotes direction of change; a C denotes the TF as targeting cholinergic core and receptor genes. \textbf{E)} Notably, there is also a set of TF that are supposedly not targeted by any smRNAs present in CD14-positive cells.
\label{fig:smrna-tf-network-fractions}}
\end{figure}

The \emph{STAT} family of transcription factors is an interesting example in this analysis. The cholinergic/neurokine interface is facilitated by JAK/STAT signalling, in which neurokine receptors can activate the pathway through STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5A/B phosphorylation. There are three differentially expressed STATs in our data set: STAT1 is down-regulated (highest absolute count-change of all TFs), targeted preferentially by tRFs (tRF fraction = 82.1\%), and directly associated with cholinergic genes in CD14-positive monocytes (»C«); STAT5B is up-regulated (second highest count-change of all TFs), preferentially targeted by miRNAs (tRF fraction = 37.5\%), and not directly associated with cholinergic genes in CD14-positive cells; and STAT2 is also down-regulated (third highest absolute count-change of all TFs), does not directly associate with cholinergic genes, and additionally is not predicted to be targeted by any smRNA present in CD14-positive monocytes, although it is expressed and induced by interferons in these cells.\cite{Lehtonen1997} 

\subsection{Dichotomous Transcriptomic Footprints of Transcription Factors\\ in CD14-positive Monocytes}
To determine the putative effect of TF regulation by each smRNA species, we evaluated the potential impact of the TFs most targeted by either miRNAs or tRFs (i.e., the two modules from Figure \ref{fig:smrna-tf-network-fractions}\,B). The top 10\% of TF targets in CD14-positive monocytes (derived from Marbach \emph{et al.}\cite{Marbach2016}) were subjected to iterative GO analysis (see Section \ref{sec:stroke:go-cd14}). Assuming a general effect of repression in tRF-targeted TFs (because the majority of DE tRFs are up-regulated), and a general de-repression in the set of miRNA-targeted TFs (because most DE miRNAs are down-regulated), the putative functional effects of changes in smRNA levels can be described by GO enrichment analysis of these two test sets.

\subsubsection{GO Term Overlap Between miRNA- and tRF-targeted Transcription Factors}
If we assume the functions associated with TF$\to$gene interaction (the »footprint«) in each subnetwork under miRNA or tRF control as an indication of the sphere of (most) influence of this smRNA species, the GO terms associated with both can give an indication of their overlapping functions. Further assuming the simplified scenario of dominating de-repression in miRNA-controlled transcripts, and dominating repression in tRF-controlled transcripts, this set of overlapping function is the set where a homeostasis is met by the cooperation of miRNAs and tRFs, or where, upon perturbations such as stroke, a shift in the balance between the two smRNA species can alter the physiological response to the stimulus.

We found 39 significant GO terms to overlap between multiple sets of miRNA- and tRF-targeted transcription factors, almost exclusively comprised of immunity-related terms. Seven terms were found with adjusted p-value < 0.001, namely: neutrophil chemotaxis (p = \e{1.3}{-4}), regulation of myeloid leukocyte differentiation (\e{2.6}{-4}), positive regulation of cold-induced thermogenesis (\e{2.8}{-4}), negative regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade (\e{3.0}{-4}), regulation of type 2 immune response (\e{4.9}{-4}), regulation of antigen receptor-mediated signalling pathway (\e{5.0}{-4}), and negative regulation of IFN-$\upgamma$ production (\e{5.9}{-4}). Further terms included positive regulation of CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cell activation (p = 0.0013), monocyte chemotaxis (0.0018), negative regulation of immune response (0.0021), response to hypoxia (0.0041), positive regulation of cytokine secretion (0.0049), and parasympathetic nervous system development (0.0051).

\subsubsection{Functions Distinguishing Between miRNA- and tRF-targeted Transcription Factors}
After removal of the overlapping GO terms between miRNA- and tRF-targeted transcription factors, the remaining miRNA- and tRF-associated sets were examined to assess their differences. In the following, only terms which had been found in at least two steps of the five-step iterative process are considered. Terms found in both sets that were not identical but very similar were also removed from the analysis.

Transcription factors from the module targeted preferentially by miRNAs (Figure \ref{fig:smrna-tf-network-fractions}\,B, blue) targeted genes that give rise to the following GO terms; several terms showed adjusted p-values below 0.001: response to TNF (p = \e{1.2}{-4}), erythrocyte differentiation (\e{2.6}{-4}), cellular response to cytokine stimulus (\e{3.5}{-4}), positive regulation of cytokine production (\e{3.8}{-4}), positive regulation of myeloid cell differentiation (\e{3.9}{-4}), regulation of IL-12 production (\e{4.9}{-4}), positive regulation of leukocyte chemotaxis (\e{6.5}{-4}), regulation of cellular response to insulin (\e{6.6}{-4}), negative regulation of T cell mediated immunity (\e{8.1}{-4}). Other terms include: regulation of macrophage activation (0.0021), response to LPS (0.0045), negative regulation of hemopoiesis (0.006), regulation of production of interleukins 1, 6, 12, 13, and 17 (all p < 0.005). These processes might, simplified, be seen as amplified, since the general down-regulation of miRNAs would lead to a de-repression of their targets. However, im many cases of »regulation«, no direction is implied.

Transcription factors from the module targeted preferentially by tRFs (Figure \ref{fig:smrna-tf-network-fractions}\,B, orange) targeted genes that give rise to the following GO terms; several terms showed adjusted p-values below 0.001: negative regulation of apoptotic process (\e{1.3}{-4}), negative regulation of coagulation (\e{1.9}{-4}), positive regulation of hemopoiesis (\e{1.9}{-4}), reg IFN gamma production (\e{2.5}{-4}), positive regulation of angiogenesis (\e{}{-4}), il4 production (\e{4.1}{-4}), nuclear pore organisation (\e{4.5}{-4}), monocyte differentiation (\e{5.0}{-4}), leukocyte migration (\e{5.2}{-4}), T cell cytokine production (\e{6.4}{-4}). Other terms include: negative regulation of NIK/NFKB signalling (0.0016), macrophage differentiation (0.0030), lymphocyte activation involved in immune response (0.0032), negative regulation of leukocyte mediated immunity (0.0043), negative regulation of neuron death (0.0052), monocyte differentiation (0.0062), negative regulation of insulin receptor signalling pathway (0.013), natural killer cell activation (0.017), positive regulation of STAT cascade (0.019), sensory perception of pain (0.026), CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell activation (0.043), production of interleukins 2 (positive), 4, 6 (all p < 0.005). These processes, as opposed to the miRNA-associated processes, might be seen as attenuated, since a strong trend towards up-regulation is seen in tRFs; this again holds only for terms where a direction is implicit or explicitly described.

Observations
From large RNA: GO JAK/STAT is suppressed (STAT1 and 2 down above lfc 1.4, 5B up, not above 1.4)

\section{Feedforward Loops of Small and Large RNA} \label{sec:stroke:ffl}
To go deeper into the transcriptional cooperation between small RNAs, transcription factors, and the genes they target, feedforward loops including all three actors can be of analytical use. Briefly, a \acf{ffl} describes a constellation of three entities (\emph{X}, \emph{Y}, and \emph{Z}), in which one entity (\emph{X}) has control over an intermediate (\emph{Y}), and both control the outcome of the ultimate (\emph{Z}).\cite{Reeves2019} \todo{figure?} Since the data on TF control over smRNAs is scarce, only cases of \emph{X} = smRNA, \emph{Y} = TF, \emph{Z} = gene can be realistically evaluated. \Acp{ffl} can be further distinguished: a coherent \ac{ffl} describes the case of regulation by \emph{X} and \emph{Y} towards \emph{Z} in a similar direction (i.e., amplification), while in an incoherent FFL, \emph{X} and \emph{Y} influence \emph{Z} in opposite directions (attenuation). While the latter is unintuitive at first sight, it can serve a multitude of meaningful functions in a cellular context, such as noise reduction, reduction of cross-contamination, or increase of temporal resolution.\cite{Lai2016}

\begin{method}

\subsection{Feedforward Loop Creation}
Starting from the set of differentially expressed TFs (p < 0.05) active in CD14-positive monocytes (as seen in Figure \ref{fig:smrna-tf-network-fractions}), single \acfp{ffl} of smRNAs (miRNA or tRF), TFs, and genes were detected using miRNeo (as described in Query \ref{lst:loop}, Section \ref{sec:database:usage}). FFLs were created CD14-positive monocyte-specific by using only TF activity from these cells and by removal of any smRNAs not detected in CD14-positive cells in the Juzenas \emph{et al.}\cite{Juzenas2017} data set. Additionally, because of the high amount of TF$\to$gene relationships in CD14-positive cells, TF relationships were filtered for the 10\% with highest activity.

\subsection{Visualisation and Modularisation}
The network of all smRNAs, TFs, and genes included in these FFLs was visualised in gephi\cite{Jacomy2014} as a two-dimensional force-directed map, using the ForceAtlas2 algorithm. At initial network creation represented by the seeds included in their sequences, which were later associated with the mature tRFs. Using a community detection algorithm\cite{Blondel2008}, the network was subclassified into five module classes (using edge weights and a resolution of 1.5, Modularity coefficient = 0.482).

\subsection{Module-specific Functions via GO Analysis}
 The module classification was reimported into R, and using R/topGO,\cite{Alexa2006} the functions of individual submodules were assessed by testing the significantly differentially expressed genes (adjusted p < 0.05) from each module against a background of 2000 randomly selected genes. Significant terms were manually screened, and differentially expressed genes were extracted from the test data for relevant terms.

\end{method}

\subsection{Feedforward Loop Network of CD14-positive Monocytes}
The complete FFL network of TFs DE in stroke patient blood (p < 0.05) was created using miRNeo and visualised in gephi. In total, 195\,043 unique FFLs were discovered, 193\,803 containing miRNAs, and only 1240 containing tRFs. After filtering of the top 10\% of TFs by activity, 19\,309 miRNA- and 169 tRF-FFLs remained. These FFLs constitute a network of 2628 nodes and 22\,456 edges (Figure \ref{fig:cd14-ffl-modules}). Community detection\cite{Blondel2008} resulted in a subclassification of nodes into five distinct modules, which were subsequently analysed for their functions using GO.

The reasoning behind this approach is to explain in more detail the findings of GO enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed large transcripts (compare Section \ref{sec:stroke:large-rna-go}), and to more closely define the pathways implicated in the context of smRNA regulatory modules. Notably, there was no cross-talk of modules across significant GO terms; if a term was found significant in GO enrichment analysis of a module, all significantly DE genes in stroke patient blood were located in this module. The following paragraphs will attempt to interpret the terms associated with each module to shed some light on the distribution of their functions and possible inter-module cooperations.

\label{fig:cd14-ffl-modules}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Module One}
GO enrichment analysis of significantly DE genes from module one resulted in 16 GO terms from 35 DE genes. The most significant biological process governed by module one is »negative regulation of transcription« with eight significant genes (SGs) and an adjusted p-value of \e{1.6}{-4}. The second and third terms indicate an influence on apoptotic processes (p = 0.0021 and 0.0049) with three SGs, which are a subset of genes from the first term, \emph{SP100}, \emph{SKIL}, and \emph{ATF3}. Further, module one genes are implicated in positive regulation of GTPase activity (5 SGs, p = 0.0069), epithelial cell differentiation (5 SGs, p = 0.0088), cellular response to IFN-$\upgamma$ (2 SGs, p = 0.024), platelet degranulation (2 SGs, p = 0.033), and cellular response to IL-1 (2 SGs, p = 0.049).

Apart from \emph{SP100} (major constituent of PML-SP100 bodies, see module three), \emph{SKIL} (part of SMAD pathway, regulating cell growth and differentiation), and \emph{ATF3} (member of the broadly acting CREB family of transcription factors), frequently implicated genes include \emph{CCL2} (chemokine ligand for CCR2, exhibits chemotactic activity for monocytes and basophils but not neutrophils and eosinophils pubmed 8627182,9792674,8195247) and \emph{CAMK1} (broadly acting calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, involved e.g. in the ERK cascade).

\subsubsection{Module Two}
Module two, being the largest module, predictably also offers most process-related terms (50 GO terms, 34 DE genes), of which most are related to immunity or basic processes of cell physiology. For the sake of clarity, immunity terms will be explored first. Module two genes most significantly participate in regulation of response to cytokine stimulus (4 SGs, p = \e{2.9}{-4}), response to LPS (5 SGs, p = \e{5.6}{-4}), inflammatory response (6 SGs, p = 0.0015), and T- and B-cell differentiation (2 SGs each, p = 0.036 and 0.041). The highest DE genes from module two involved in these processes are \emph{SORL1} (a known regulator of neurokine signalling), \emph{STAT5B}, the IL-10 receptor $\upalpha$, \emph{PLXNB2} (involved in cell migration),  \emph{JAK2}, the transcription factor \emph{KLF4} (), \emph{PTPN2} (phosphatase involved in dephosphorylating JAKs and STATs), and \emph{CXCL10} (pro-inflammatory chemokine ligand implicated in response to brain injury by activating microglia).
 
Non-immune physiological terms refer to regulation of cell migration (8 SGs, p = \e{1.4}{-4}), negative regulation of MAPK cascade (4 SGs, p = \e{4.7}{-4}), cellular response to peptide (5 SGs, p = \e{9.5}{-4}), nucleus organisation (3 SGs, p = 0.0010), erythrocyte differentiation (3 SGs, p = 0.0010), regulation of ERK cascade (3 SGs, p = 0.0085), regulation of angiogenesis ( SGs, p = 0.0010), regulation of cold-induced thermogenesis (2 SGs, p = 0.031) and several more basic processes. Many of these processes appear to be vital to the immune functions described above, as they share many of the most highly DE genes, such as \emph{SORL1}, \emph{STAT5B}, \emph{PLXNB4}, \emph{KLF4}, and \emph{PTPN2}. Thus, module two genes seem to be responsible for facilitating an adequate immune response by modifying basic processes to enable immune cells to fulfil their functions (e.g., response to cytokines and cellular mobility). 
 
\subsubsection{Module Three}
Module three, with 14 GO terms and 13 DE genes, appears similar in principle to module two, although much fewer basic physiological terms are involved. The most significant biological processes of module two genes involve cellular response to IFN-$\upgamma$ (3 SGs, p = \e{1.6}{-4}) and positive regulation of transcription (5 SGs, p = \e{9.1}{-4}), as opposed to negative regulation of transcription (most significant term in module one). Further, module three genes are involved in the cytokine-mediated signalling pathway (4 SGs, p = 0.0018), regulation of IFN production (2 SGs, p = 0.0034), JAK-STAT cascade (2 SGs, p = 0.0048), negative regulation of angiogenesis (2 SGs, p = 0.0056), regulation of innate immune response (2 SGs, p = 0.035), and positive regulation of cytokine production (2 SGs, p = 0.048). Most frequently occurring genes are \emph{STAT1} and \emph{STAT2}, \emph{PLSCR1} (implicated in amplification of IFN response), \emph{PML} (also associated with IFN- and TNF-responses), and \emph{IRF5} (implicated in TLR7/8-induced induction of IFNs and other pro-inflammatory cytokines).

Mediation of pro-inflammatory cytokine signals via JAK/STAT, opposing module one?

\subsubsection{Module Four}
Module four, with 12 significant GO terms from 7 DE genes, is a fairly small module, which is nevertheless highly associated with immune processes; most significantly, genes of module four convey positive regulation of innate immune response (2 SGs, p = 0.0039) and positive regulation of cytokine production (2 SGs, p = 0.0075). More accurately, they are involved in IL-1 production (1 SG, p = 0.038). Further, module four genes show association with negative regulation of myeloid cell differentiation (1 SG, p = 0.038), positive regulation of response to cytokine (1 SG, p = 0.038), myeloid cell homeostasis (1 SG, p = 0.042), positive regulation of inflammatory response (1 SG, p = 0.045), and negative regulation of myeloid leukocyte differentiation (1 SG, p = 0.049). The most important DE genes in these terms are \emph{GBP5} (activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly), \emph{MAFB} (transcription factor required for monocyte differentiation), and \emph{ZBP1} (cytoplasmic DNA-sensor which activates downstream IFN production in activated macrophages). 
 


\subsubsection{Module Five}
Module five is a medium-sized module (29 GO terms from 18 DE genes) which is only loosely associated with immunity. Most terms relate to basic molecular functions of the cell, such as regulation of cell-substrate adhesion, cellular component maintenance, membrane depolarisation, regulation of protein tyrosine kinase activation, positive regulation of small molecule metabolism, fatty acid metabolic process, and several more. The genes most highly implicated in these processes are \emph{SRC} (tyrosine kinase activated by immune response receptors, that facilitates immune response, adhesion and migration, and apoptosis), \emph{ABCD1} (ATP-binding cassette transporter for very-long-chain fatty acids, implicated in regulation of inflammatory response by positively regulating peroxisomal beta-oxidation), and \emph{HDAC7} (histone deacetylase, in association with RARA has been shown to suppress hsa-miR-10a and thereby influence inflammatory response pubmed28167758).

%Reduction of dimensionality of high-dimensional data, such as the expression of thousands of small RNA species and their correlation with clinical parameters of patients, can also be achieved by means of Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA, also R/WGCNA).\cite{Langfelder2008} The aim of this method is the identification of modules that group similarly-expressed genes. Each of these modules is represented by an eigenvector (called \emph{eigengene}), effectively replacing the individual expression parameters of the genes in the module. The eigengene can then be used to determine correlation of covariates to each module.
%
%To represent expression data in a network-based manner, the expression matrix is transformed into an adjacency matrix representing similarities between nodes, i.e., genes. The co-expression similarity $s_{ij}$ between two nodes $i$ and $j$ is defined as the absolute correlation coefficient between the expression profiles $$s_{ij} = |cor(x_i, x_j)|$$ with $x$ representing the node expression profile. A signed co-expression measure can be used to keep track of the direction of co-expression. Weighted networks allow the adjacency measures to assume continuous values between 0 and 1, thereby retaining the continuous nature of the underlying expression matrix. This is achieved by implementation of a soft threshold, which is usually chosen by the user to result in a scale-free network topology. The connectivity distribution in a scale-free network follows a power law, i.e., the probability of a node with $k$ connections is, for large values of $k$: $$P(k) = k^{-\alpha}$$ With $\alpha$ usually between 2 and 3. Many biological networks are assumed to be scale-free; however, this assumption has very recently been empirically questioned.\cite{Broido2019}
%
%Once the network is created, modules are identified via unsupervised clustering of densely connected nodes. Biological significance can then be assigned to each of the modules and genes. Module eigengenes can be calculated (the first principal component of the module) and correlated to traits, such as clinical parameters. In this manner, modules with potential functional implications can be identified.
%
%\subsection{Co-correlation}
%The fact that a subset of small \ac{seq} samples were also subjected to large \ac{seq} enables the application of a secondary correlation between those two approaches. For instance, module eigengenes derived from \ac{smrna} analysis can be correlated with the mRNA module eigengenes across the common patients. The module similarity $\sigma$ thus is defined as the correlation coefficient between eigengene profiles $e$ of modules $i$ and $j$: $$\sigma = |cor(e_i, e_j)|$$
%
%Significantly correlating modules (p < 0.05) were identified and further analysed downstream.
