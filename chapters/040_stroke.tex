\chapter[Dynamics Between Small and Large RNA\texorpdfstring{\\}{} in the Blood of Stroke Victims]{Dynamics Between Small and Large RNA in the Blood of Stroke Victims}

Stroke is a dramatic incision into bodily homeostasis and affects a multitude of organ functions, first and foremost the brain. The immediate actions upon stroke are focused on preserving as much functional tissue as possible, so as to alleviate the cognitive damages resulting from neuron death. After this initial period of few hours, longer-lasting processes determine the health and recovery of the patient. Many of these later events are related to immunity. The greatest danger to the patient after survival of the initial period are infections, such as pneumonia, usually between one and two weeks after the infarction. Pneumonia is often facilitated by aspiration of liquids or solids when the swallowing mechanism is impaired as a consequence of the cerebral damage. However, as introduced in Section \ref{sec:intro:stroke}, stroke-related immunodepression can play a role in post-stroke survival, and has been shown to have an impact on the transcriptome of blood-borne immune cells, at least for protein coding genes. The role of short RNA transcripts, and particularly of transfer RNA fragments, is much less clear. We thus opted to analyse the blood of stroke victims taken upon hospitalisation and screen it for changes in small and large RNA expression.
