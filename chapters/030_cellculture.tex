\chapter[microRNA Dynamics in Cholinergic Differentiation\texorpdfstring{\\}{} of Human Neuronal Cells]{microRNA Dynamics in Cholinergic Differentiation of Human Neuronal Cells}
This chapter will discuss the current state of knowledge on brain transcriptomics, generally and in the specific case of cholinergic neurons in the \ac{cns}, and then go on to explain the steps we undertook to elucidate small RNA processes in central cholinergic systems. First, our aim was to clarify co-expression patterns of central cholinergic neurons, which required analysis of transcriptome data in single-cell resolution. Based on this information, we selected two human models of cholinergic neuronal differentiation and established a differentiation protocol amenable to RNA extraction and successive molecular biology assays, most importantly, \ac{seq}. The expression patterns so obtained were then used to perform bioinformatics analyses using the database introduced in Chapter \ref{sec:database}, \textit{miRNeo}.
