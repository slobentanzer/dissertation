\chapter{microRNA Dynamics in Cholinergic Differentiation of Human Neuronal Cells}

\newthought{Even though much has been achieved} in the integrative study of \ac{mir} control of gene expression, computational analysis of transcriptional interactions has not yet reached the level of sophistication needed for the accurate prediction of events inside mammalian cells. For this reason, a combination of a bioinformatical assay with modern molecular biology methods can strengthen the message and reproducibility of any approach. The spectrum of processes worthy of study is as wide as modern biomedicine. Similarly, experimental models can span the entire repertoire available to a modern laboratory. The selection of a model adequate to the research question therefore is as important as diligent analysis and careful interpretation of results.

Multicellular model prohibited by tissue specificity and novelty, animal model prohibited by lack of transferability, diseases have to be introduced up top

In-vivo situation unclear

Paucity of accurate data in mammals

Advent of single-cell sequencing

Sex differences prompted by disease distribution
