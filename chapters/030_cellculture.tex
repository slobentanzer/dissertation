There is no scientific study more vital to man than the study of his own brain. Our entire view of the universe depends on it.\qauthor{Francis Crick}

% If the human brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn’t.
% – Emerson M. Pugh

% The human brain, then, is the most complicated organisation of matter that we know.     
% Isaac Asimov

% One of the difficulties in understanding the brain is that it is like nothing so much as a lump of porridge.
% Richard L. Gregory

% The brain is a monstrous, beautiful mess. Its billions of nerve cells - called neurons - lie in a tangled web that displays cognitive powers far exceeding any of the silicon machines we have built to mimic it.
% William Allman

\chapter{microRNA Dynamics in Cholinergic Differentiation of Human Neuronal Cells}
This chapter will discuss the current state of knowledge on brain transcriptomics, generally and in the specific case of cholinergic neurons in the \ac{cns}, and then go on to explain the steps we undertook to elucidate small RNA processes in central cholinergic systems. First, our aim was to clarify co-expression patterns of central cholinergic neurons, which required analysis of transcriptome data in single-cell resolution. Based on this information, we selected two human models of cholinergic neuronal differentiation and established a differentiation protocol amenable to RNA extraction and successive molecular biology assays, most importantly, \ac{seq}. The expression patterns so obtained were then used to perform bioinformatics analyses using the database introduced in Chapter \ref{sec:database:mirnet}, \textit{miRNetDB}.
