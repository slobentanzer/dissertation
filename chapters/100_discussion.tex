\section{Methods} \label{sec:discussion:methods}
database, approach, compare to new developments (mirDIP)
graph as main advantage for dynamic analyses such as FFLs

cell model, chat anomaly, regulation of expression of these two, induction, low vs high control genes


\section{The Cholinergic/Neurokine Interface}
Hypothesis: cholinergic and neurokine systems intermingle significantly in the cns, affecting physiological as well as pathogenic (pathologic?) processes. Multiple angles reject null (orthogonal evidence)

feedforward loops: tRFs ample targeting in modules, but minor in ffls... implications? less TF targeting, more "end user" gene targeting?

\section{Small RNA Therapeutics and Pharmacology} \label{sec:discussion:therapy}
Extant approaches, methods, diseases, PCSK9, asthma, using small RNA antisense as substitute for single-target small molecules, reduce off-target effects, side effects of a different kind

Transcriptomics as basis for selection and design of antisense therapy, combinatorial, compare dirty drugs from psychiatric disorders, serendipity impossible, determinant is the sequence as opposed to functional groups that can be iteratively modified (only 4 building blocks)
