## Abstract
Natural science is only just beginning to understand the complex processes surrounding transcription.
Epitranscriptional regulation is in large parts conveyed by transcription factors (TFs) and
two recently discovered small RNA (smRNA) species: microRNAs (miRNAs) and transfer RNA
fragments (tRFs). As opposed to the fairly well-characterised function of TFs in shaping the phenotype
of the cell, the effects and mechanism of action of smRNA species is less well understood. In
particular, the multi-levelled combinatorial interaction (many-to-many) of smRNAs presents new
challenges to molecular biology. This dissertation contributes to the study of smRNA dynamics in
mammalian cells in several ways, which are presented in three main chapters.

I) The exhaustive analysis of the many-to-many network of smRNA regulation is reliant on bioinformatic
support. Here, I describe the development of an integrative database capable of fast and
efficient computation of complex multi-levelled transcriptional interactions, named miRNeo. This
infrastructure is then applied to two use cases. II) To elucidate smRNA dynamics of cholinergic systems
and their relevance to psychiatric disease, an integrative transcriptomics analysis is performed
on patient brain sample data, single-cell sequencing data, and two closely related in vitro human
cholinergic cellular models reflecting male and female phenotypes. III) The dynamics between small
and large RNA transcripts in the blood of stroke victims are analysed via a combination of sequencing,
analysis of sorted blood cell populations, and bioinformatic methods based on the miRNeo
infrastructure. Particularly, importance and practicality of smRNA:TF:gene feedforward loops are
assessed.

In both analytic scenarios, I identify the most pertinent regulators of disease-relevant processes
and biological pathways implicated in either pathogenesis or responses to the disease. While the
examples described in chapters three and four of this dissertation are disease-specific applications of
miRNeo, the database and methods described have been developed to be applicable to the whole
genome and all known smRNAs.
