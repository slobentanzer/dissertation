abstract = {Human and murine immune cells such as mononuclear leukocytes consisting of mainly T and B cells, bone marrow derived dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages all express various nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (nAChR) subunits. Activated T cells and DCs have the ability to synthesize ACh by choline acetyltransferase, suggesting the role of non-neuronal cholinergic system expressed in immune cells in the regulation of immune cell function. Stimulation of human leukemic T and B cell lines with nicotine causes a transient Ca(2+)-signaling that is antagonized by alpha-bungarotoxin, suggesting the involvement of alpha7 subunit. Furthermore, alpha7 nAChRs have been shown to negatively regulate synthesis and release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in macrophages. These findings suggest that immune cell function is regulated by its own non-neuronal cholinergic system, at least in part, via alpha7 nAChR-mediated pathways. In the present study, we tested the role of alpha7 nAChRs in the regulation of immune function by measuring total serum and antigen-specific IgG(1) and IgM, and production of TNF-alpha, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukin (IL)-6 in activated spleen cells of nAChR alpha7 subunit gene knockout (alpha7 KO) and wild-type C57BL/6J mice immunized with ovalbumin (OVA). We found that serum levels of total and anti-OVA-specific IgG(1) were significantly elevated in alpha7 KO mice, though there were no significant differences in serum levels of total and anti-OVA-specific IgM between the two genotypes. Production of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-6 in spleen cells was significantly facilitated in alpha7 KO mice. Expression of AChE mRNA was not different between the two genotypes. These results suggest that alpha7 nAChRs are involved in the regulation of cytokine production, through which modulates TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-6 productions, leading to modification of antibody production, but are not involved in expression of cholinergic components in immune cells.},

abstract = {T and B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) all express most of the components necessary for a functional cholinergic system. This includes choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (mAChRs and nAChRs, respectively) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Immunological activation of T cells up-regulates cholinergic activity, including ChAT and AChE expression. Moreover, toll-like receptor agonists induce ChAT expression in DCs and macrophages, suggesting cholinergic involvement in the regulation of immune function. Immune cells express all five M1–M5 mAChR subtypes and several nAChR subtypes, including $\alpha$7. Modulation of antigen-specific antibody and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in M1/M5 mAChR gene-knockout (KO) and $\alpha$7 nAChR-KO mice further support the idea of a non-neuronal cholinergic system contributing to the regulation of immune function. Evidence also suggests that $\alpha$7 nAChRs are involved in suppressing DC and macrophage activity, leading to suppression of T cell differentiation into effector T cells. These findings suggest the possibility that immune function could be modulated by manipulating immune cell cholinergic activity using specific agonists and antagonists. Therefore, a fuller understanding of the immune cell cholinergic system should be useful for the development of drugs and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases and cancers.},

Serum ANG levels were significantly higher in patients with cerebral infarction within 48 h and on days 3 and 7 than in the control group (p {\textless} 0.05). Serum ANG level decreased on day 14. Serum ANG levels were significantly higher in patients with large infarction than in those with moderate and small infarction at each time point (p {\textless} 0.05). Our observations that serum ANG levels increase significantly in patients with cerebral infarction and the increase in ANG levels correlates with the infarct size suggest that ANG might be involved in the pathophysiologic process of ischemic brain damage.

The nervous system, via an inflammatory reflex of the vagus nerve, can inhibit cytokine release and thereby prevent tissue injury and death. The efferent neural signaling pathway is termed the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway. Cholinergic agonists inhibit cytokine synthesis and protect against cytokine-mediated diseases. Stimulation of the vagus nerve prevents the damaging effects of cytokine release in experimental sepsis, endotoxemia, ischemia/reperfusion injury, hemorrhagic shock, arthritis, and other inflammatory syndromes. Herein is a review of this physiological, functional anatomical mechanism for neurological regulation of cytokine-dependent disease that begins to define an immunological homunculus.},

abstract = {Lymphocytes possess all the components required to constitute an independent, non-neuronal cholinergic system. These include acetylcholine (ACh); choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), its synthesizing enzyme; and both muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors (mAChRs and nAChRs, respectively). ACh modifies T and B cell function via both mAChR- and nAChR-mediated pathways. Stimulation of lymphocytes with the T cell activator phytohemagglutinin, protein kinase C activator phorbol ester, or cell surface molecules enhances the synthesis and release of ACh and up-regulates ChAT and/or M(5) mAChR gene expression. Furthermore, animal models of immune disorders exhibit abnormal lymphocytic cholinergic activity. The cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin attenuates the lymphocytic cholinergic activity of T cells by inhibiting LFA-1 signaling in a manner independent of its cholesterol-lowering activity. This suggests that simvastatin exerts its immunosuppressive effects in part by modifying lymphocytic cholinergic activity. Nicotine, an active ingredient of tobacco, ameliorates ulcerative colitis but exacerbates Crohn's disease. Expression of mRNAs encoding the nAChR alpha7 and alpha5 subunits are significantly diminished in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes from smokers, as compared with those from nonsmokers. In addition, long-term exposure of lymphocytes to nicotine reduces intracellular Ca(2+) signaling via alpha7 nAChR-mediated pathways. In fact, studies of humoral antibody production in M(1)/M(5) mAChR-deficient and alpha7 nAChR-deficient animals revealed the role of lymphocytic cholinergic activity in the regulation of immune function. These results provide clues to understanding the mechanisms underlying immune system regulation and could serve as the basis for the development of new immunomodulatory drugs.},

abstract = {Ischemic injuries will lead to necrotic tissue damage, and post-ischemia angiogenesis plays critical roles in blood flow restoration and tissue recovery. Recently, several types of small RNAs have been reported to be involved in this process. In this study, we first generated a rat brain ischemic model to investigate the involvement of new types of small RNAs in ischemia. We utilized deep sequencing and bioinformatics analyses to demonstrate that the level of small RNA fragments derived from tRNAs strikingly increased in the ischemic rat brain. Among these sequences, tRNAVal - and tRNAGly-derived small RNAs account for the most abundant segments. The up-regulation of tRNAVal - and tRNAGly-derived fragments was verified through northern blot and quantitative PCR analyses. The levels of these two fragments also increased in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model and cellular hypoxia model. Importantly, up-regulation of the tRNAVal - and tRNAGly -derived fragments in endothelial cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration and tube formation. Furthermore, we showed that these small RNAs are generated by angiogenin cleavage. Our results indicate that tRNA-derived fragments are involved in tissue ischemia, and we demonstrate for the first time that tRNAVal - and tRNAGly-derived fragments inhibit angiogenesis by modulating the function of endothelial cells.},

abstract = {Articular cartilage contains both chondrocyte cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Currently, comprehensive information concerning the protein composition of human articular cartilage tissue is somewhat lacking. In this report we detail the use of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for a preliminary global identification of proteins from human articular knee cartilage tissue from patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis. Knee cartilage supernatant was fractionated using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D-SDS-PAGE), in-gel digested and peptide sequences were then determined by performing on-line nano-liquid chromatography (LC)/MS/MS experiments using an ion trap mass spectrometer. Altogether, over 100 different proteins from nearly 700 unique peptide sequences were detected by MS/MS. The majority of the proteins identified are involved in ECM organization (35{\%}), signal transduction and cell communication (14{\%}), immune response (11{\%}) and metabolism and energy pathways (11{\%}). Proteins observed included several well-known cartilage components as well as lower abundant lesser known ECM proteins. Possible degradation products in the cartilage sample, such as from cartilage link protein, could also be detected by our mass spectrometry methods. We show here that mass spectrometry can be utilized as a tool for a fast, accurate and sensitive analysis of a complex mixture of cartilage proteins. It is believed that this type of proteomic analysis will aid future work centered on investigating the pathology of this and other related joint diseases.},

abstract = {Activity-dependent changes in gene-expression are believed to underlie the molecular representation of memory. In this study, we report that in vivo activation of neurons rapidly induces the CREB-regulated microRNA miR-132. To determine if production of miR-132 is regulated by neuronal activity its expression in mouse brain was monitored by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). Pilocarpine-induced seizures led to a robust, rapid, and transient increase in the primary transcript of miR-132 (pri-miR-132) followed by a subsequent rise in mature microRNA (miR-132). Activation of neurons in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and striatum by contextual fear conditioning, odor-exposure, and cocaine-injection, respectively, also increased pri-miR-132. Induction kinetics of pri-miR-132 were monitored and found to parallel those of immediate early genes, peaking at 45 min and returning to basal levels within 2 h of stimulation.

abstract = {The molecular mechanisms underlying human brain evolution are not fully understood; however, previous work suggested that expression of the transcription factor CLOCK in the human cortex might be relevant to human cognition and disease. In this study, we investigated this novel transcriptional role for CLOCK in human neurons by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing for endogenous CLOCK in adult neocortices and RNA sequencing following CLOCK knockdown in differentiated human neurons in vitro. These data suggested that CLOCK regulates the expression of genes involved in neuronal migration, and a functional assay showed that CLOCK knockdown increased neuronal migratory distance. Furthermore, dysregulation of CLOCK disrupts coexpressed networks of genes implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, and the expression of these networks is driven by hub genes with human-specific patterns of expression. These data support a role for CLOCK-regulated transcriptional cascades involved in human brain evolution and function.},

abstract = {Fluorescent labeling of proteins by genetically encoded fluorescent protein tags has enabled an enhanced understanding of cell biological processes but is restricted to the analysis of a limited number of identified proteins. This approach does not permit, e.g., the unbiased visualization of a full proteome in situ. We describe here a fluorescence-based method to follow proteome-wide patterns of newly synthesized proteins in cultured cells, tissue slices, and a whole organism. This technique is compatible with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Key to this method is the introduction of a small bio-orthogonal reactive group by metabolic labeling. This is accomplished by replacing the amino acid methionine by the azide-bearing methionine surrogate azidohomoalanine (AHA) in a step very similar to classical radioisotope labeling. Subsequently, an alkyne-bearing fluorophore is covalently attached to the group by "click chemistry"--a copper(I)-catalyzed [3+2]azide-alkyne cycloaddition. By similar means, metabolic labeling can also be performed with the alkyne-bearing homopropargylglycine (HPG) and clicked to an azide-functionalized fluorophore.},

abstract = {Although several studies have suggested that cortical alterations underlie such age-related visual deficits as decreased acuity, little is known about what changes actually occur in visual cortex during healthy aging. Two recent studies showed changes in primary visual cortex (V1) during normal aging; however, no studies have characterized the effects of aging on visual cortex beyond V1, important measurements both for understanding the aging process and for comparison to changes in age-related diseases. Similarly, there is almost no information about changes in visual cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Because visual deficits are often reported as one of the first symptoms of AD, measurements of such changes in the visual cortex of AD patients might improve our understanding of how the visual system is affected by neurodegeneration as well as aid early detection, accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of AD. Here we use fMRI to first compare the visual field map (VFM) organization and population receptive fields (pRFs) between young adults and healthy aging subjects for occipital VFMs V1, V2, V3, and hV4. Healthy aging subjects do not show major VFM organizational deficits, but do have reduced surface area and increased pRF sizes in the foveal representations of V1, V2, and hV4 relative to healthy young control subjects. These measurements are consistent with behavioral deficits seen in healthy aging. We then demonstrate the feasibility and first characterization of these measurements in two patients with mild AD, which reveal potential changes in visual cortex as part of the pathophysiology of AD. Our data aid in our understanding of the changes in the visual processing pathways in normal aging and provide the foundation for future research into earlier and more definitive detection of AD.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of cell-fate decisions in development and disease with a vast array of target interactions that can be inves-tigated using computational approaches. For this study, we developed metaMIR, a combinatorial ap-proach to identify miRNAs that co-regulate identi-fied subsets of genes from a user-supplied list. We based metaMIR predictions on an improved dataset of human miRNA–target interactions, compiled us-ing a machine-learning-based meta-analysis of es-tablished algorithms. Simultaneously, the inverse dataset of negative interactions not likely to occur was extracted to increase classifier performance, as measured using an expansive set of experimentally validated interactions from a variety of sources. In a second differential mode, candidate miRNAs are predicted by indicating genes to be targeted and oth-ers to be avoided to potentially increase specificity of results. As an example, we investigate the neu-ral crest, a transient structure in vertebrate devel-opment where miRNAs play a pivotal role. Patterns of metaMIR-predicted miRNA regulation alone par-tially recapitulated functional relationships among genes, and separate differential analysis revealed miRNA candidates that would downregulate com-ponents implicated in cancer progression while not targeting tumour suppressors. Such an approach could aid in therapeutic application of miRNAs to re-duce unintended effects. The utility is available at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/metaMIR/.},

However, recent studies point to the existence of axon-autonomous mechanism(s) that regulate rapid axon degeneration after axotomy. Here, we review the cellular and molecular events that underlie this process, termed Wallerian degeneration. We describe the biphasic nature of axon degeneration after axotomy and our current understanding of how Wld(S)--an extraordinary protein formed by fusing a Ube4b sequence to Nmnat1--acts to protect severed axons. Interestingly, the neuroprotective effects of Wld(S) span all species tested, which suggests that there is an ancient, Wld(S)-sensitive axon destruction program. Recent studies with Wld(S) also reveal that Wallerian degeneration is genetically related to several dying back axonopathies, thus arguing that Wallerian degeneration can serve as a useful model to understand, and potentially treat, axon degeneration in diverse traumatic or disease contexts.},

Studies conducted in a variety of neuropsychiatric populations [e.g. attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia] have collectively suggested that nicotine may be efficacious in remediating selected cognitive deficits associated with these disorders, thus providing a framework for understanding the specific vulnerability of these patients to smoking initiation and maintenance. However, the specific gain in cognitive performance produced by nicotine administration in healthy subjects with normal cognitive function is less clear. This article reviews our current understanding of central nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) systems in normal and neuropsychiatric disease states and, specifically, their role with respect to cognitive dysfunction and clinical symptoms in several specific neuropsychiatric populations, including ADHD, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Tourette's Disorder, schizophrenia and affective disorders.

abstract = {A remarkable discovery of recent years is that, despite the complexity of ageing, simple genetic interventions can increase lifespan and improve health during ageing in laboratory animals. The pathways involved have often proved to sense nutrients and to match costly activities of organisms, such as growth, metabolism and reproduction, to nutrient status. For instance, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor and Target of Rapamycin signalling network has proved to play a function in ageing, from yeast to mammals, seemingly including humans. In the fruit fly Drosophila, altered activity of several components of this network can increase lifespan and improve locomotor and cardiac function during ageing. The fly brain, fat body (equivalent of mammalian liver and white adipose tissue) and the germ line are important in determination of lifespan, with considerable communication between different tissues. Cellular detoxification pathways, increased autophagy and altered protein synthesis have all been implicated in increased lifespan from reduced IIS/TOR activity, with the role of defence against oxidative stress unresolved. Reduced IIS/TOR signalling can alter or block the response of lifespan to dietary restriction. Reduced IIS can act acutely to lower death rate, implying that it may ameliorate the effects of ageing-related damage, rather than preventing it. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Few data are available concerning the role of risk markers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in progression to AD dementia among subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We therefore investigated the role of well-known AD-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the progression from MCI to AD dementia. Four independent MCI data sets were included in the analysis: (a) the German study on Aging, Cognition and Dementia in primary care patients (n=853); (b) the German Dementia Competence Network (n=812); (c) the Fundacio ACE from Barcelona, Spain (n=1245); and (d) the MCI data set of the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (n=306). The effects of single markers and combined polygenic scores were measured using Cox proportional hazards models and meta-analyses. The clusterin (CLU) locus was an independent genetic risk factor for MCI to AD progression (CLU rs9331888: hazard ratio (HR)=1.187 (1.054-1.32); P=0.0035). A polygenic score (PGS1) comprising nine established genome-wide AD risk loci predicted a small effect on the risk of MCI to AD progression in APOE-4 (apolipoprotein E-4) carriers (HR=1.746 (1.029-2.965); P=0.038). The novel AD loci reported by the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project were not implicated in MCI to AD dementia progression. SNP-based polygenic risk scores comprising currently available AD genetic markers did not predict MCI to AD progression. We conclude that SNPs in CLU are potential markers for MCI to AD progression.

More recently, the heritability of MDD has been estimated on large populations from registries such as the Swedish, Finnish, and Chinese cohorts. Family-based designs utilise a number of different relationships and provide an alternative means of estimating heritability. Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) is a large (n = 20,198), family-based population study designed to identify the genetic determinants of common diseases, including Major Depressive Disorder. Two thousand seven hundred and six individuals were SCID diagnosed with MDD, 13.5{\%} of the cohort, from which we inferred a population prevalence of 12.2{\%} (95{\%} credible interval: 11.4{\%} to 13.1{\%}). Increased risk of MDD was associated with being female, unemployed due to a disability, current smokers, former drinkers, and living in areas of greater social deprivation. The heritability of MDD in GS:SFHS was between 28{\%} and 44{\%}, estimated from a pedigree model. The genetic correlation of MDD between sexes, age of onset, and illness course were examined and showed strong genetic correlations. The genetic correlation between males and females with MDD was 0.75 (0.43 to 0.99); between earlier (≤ age 40) and later ({\textgreater} age 40) onset was 0.85 (0.66 to 0.98); and between single and recurrent episodic illness course was 0.87 (0.72 to 0.98). We found that the heritability of recurrent MDD illness course was significantly greater than the heritability of single MDD illness course. The study confirms a moderate genetic contribution to depression, with a small contribution of the common family environment (variance proportion = 0.07, CI: 0.01 to 0.15), and supports the relationship of MDD with previously identified risk factors. This study did not find robust support for genetic differences in MDD due to sex, age of onset, or illness course. However, we found an intriguing difference in heritability between recurrent and single MDD illness course. These findings establish GS:SFHS as a valuable cohort for the genetic investigation of MDD.},

However, it is unclear exactly what environmental factors may trigger this pathogenetic tau hyperphosphorylation. From several perspectives, the coagulation serine protease, thrombin, has been implicated in AD and activates several different protein kinase pathways but has not previously been shown how it may contribute to AD pathogenesis. Here we report that nanomolar thrombin induced rapid tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation in murine hippocampal neurons via protease-activated receptors, which was followed by delayed synaptophysin reduction and apoptotic neuronal death. Mechanistic study revealed that a persistent thrombin signaling via protease-activated receptor 4 and prolonged downstream p44/42 mitogenactivated protein kinase activation are at least in part responsible. These results pathogenetically linked thrombin to subpopulations of AD and other tauopathies associated with cerebrovascular damage. Such knowledge may be instrumental in transforming therapeutic paradigms.},

Surprisingly, in the striatum of the PRiMA knock-out mouse, despite a normal level of AChE mRNA, we find only 2-3{\%} of wild type AChE activity, with the residual AChE localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, demonstrating that PRiMA in vivo is necessary for intracellular processing of AChE in neurons. Moreover, deletion of the retention signal of the AChE catalytic subunit in mice, which is the domain of interaction with PRiMA, does not restore AChE activity in the striatum, establishing that PRiMA is necessary to target and/or to stabilize nascent AChE in neurons. These unexpected findings open new avenues to modulating AChE activity and its distribution in CNS disorders.},

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine ATF3 expression and the most effective ATF3 siRNA was selected for further studies. Flow cytometry was applied to investigate the effects of ATF3 deletion on RGC-5 apoptosis under elevated hydrostatic pressure. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were performed to validate differentially expressed genes and proteins in ATF3-knockdown RGC-5 cells. RESULTS ATF3 specific siRNA effectively down-regulated ATF3 expression and significantly inhibited cell apoptosis in RGC-5 cells. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot confirmed that ATF3 knockdown remarkably decreased Jun-B and increased c-Jun at both mRNA and protein levels in RGC-5 cells. CONCLUSION ATF/cAMP-response element-binding family of transcription factors may be involved in the development of glaucoma and could be novel treatment targets for glaucoma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) play critical roles in learning, memory and cognition. Dysfunction or degeneration of BFCNs may connect to neuropathology, such as Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome and dementia. Generation of functional BFCNs may contribute to the studies of cell-based therapy and pathogenesis that is related to learning and memory deficits.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nNEW METHOD: Here we describe a detail method for robust generation of BFCNs from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In this method, BFCN progenitors are patterned from hESC or hiPSC-derived primitive neuroepithelial cells, with the treatment of sonic hedgehog (SHH) or combination with its agonist Purmorphamine, and by co-culturing with human astrocytes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: At day 20, ∼90{\%} hPSC-derived progenitors expressed NKX2.1, which is a transcriptional marker for MGE. Moreover, around 40{\%} of NKX2.1+ cells co-expressed OLIG2 and ∼15{\%} of NKX2.1+ cells co-expressed ISLET1, which are ventral markers. At day 35, ∼40{\%} neurons robustly express ChAT, most of which are co-labeled with NKX2.1, ISLET1 and FOXG1, indicating the basal forebrain-like identity. At day 45, these neurons express mature neuronal markers MAP2, Synapsin, and VAChT.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCOMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): In this method, undefined conditions including genetic modification or cell-sorting are avoided. As a choice, feeder free conditions are used to avoid ingredients of animal origin. Moreover, Purmorphamine can be substituted for SHH to induce ventral progenitors effectively and economically.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We provide an efficient method to generate BFCNs from multiple hPSC lines, which offers the potential application for disease modeling and pharmacological studies.},

abstract = {Environmental enrichment (EE) has an influential role in reducing behavioral reactivity to stress. We previously observed that EE reduces the anxiety-like behavior in the field mouse Mus booduga accompanied by a reduction in the expression of molecules involved in the stress pathway. In this study, we demonstrate the effect of different housing condition on regulation of micro-RNA-183-SC35-mediated splicing of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Adult male M. booduga were captured from an agricultural field and housed under nonenriched standard conditions (SC) for 7 days and considered as directly from the wild (DW). On day 8, individuals were randomly assigned to three groups; DW, SC, and EE. The DW group's anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT). The SC and EE groups were transferred to their respective conditions and housed for another 30 days. The mice housed in EE showed less anxiety-like behavior on EPM and in OFT compared with DW and SC mice. Interestingly, miR-183 expression was increased following exposure to EPM in EE mice but not in SC mice. Subsequently, the upregulated miR-183 expression suppresses the SC35 expression and shifting of splicing from AChE-S (synaptic) to AChE-R (read-through) form, whereas standard housing condition downregulate miR-183 and induces the splicing of AChE. The upregulated AChE-R form possibly terminates ACh transmission, which is reflected in the level of anxiety-like behavior. Overall, the present study suggests that EE effectively regulates the miR-183 pathway to reduce anxiety-like behavior.},

METHODS: Using quantitative PCR, we profiled the expression level of 728 miRNAs in CSF of nonaffected control subjects and patients with clinically ascertained AD dementia, and we further compared the expression level of candidate miRNAs in 37 control subjects and 35 patients with AD dementia. RESULTS: The level of hsa-miR-27a-3p in CSF is reduced in patients with dementia due to AD in 2 different cohorts of subjects (cohort 1: p = 0.008; cohort 2: p = 0.015; 2-tailed unpaired Welch t test). Moreover, low levels of hsa-miR-27a-3p were accompanied by high CSF tau levels and low CSF beta-amyloid levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study highlights hsa-miR-27a-3p as a candidate biomarker for AD and provides the groundwork for further confirmation studies in larger cohorts and in other hospitals.},

abstract = {Cholinergically differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were treated with a pathophysiologically relevant, low (300nM), and a high (3$\mu$M) dose of amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta) or 42-1 (revAbeta). At early (1 and 4h) and late (24h) time points, the pro- and anti-apoptotic factors - caspase-3 and p53, and Bcl-2, respectively - were assessed together with LDH release as measure of cell viability and ATP levels as marker of mitochondrial activity. The low peptide dose significantly increased Bcl-2 and, time-delayed, caspase-3 and ATP levels, but barely impacted on LDH release, while the high concentration remarkably depressed Bcl-2 levels, depleted ATP and led to increased LDH release. We also monitored acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymatic activity and splice variant levels (tailed and readthrough AChE; AChE-T and AChE-R), and assessed choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and high affinity choline uptake (HACU). The low Abeta concentration drastically upregulated AChE-R and increased both ChAT and HACU, while the high dose caused cholinergic toxicity. We believe this study offers the first insight into the highly concentration-dependent effects of Abeta on cholinergic dynamics. In particular, it highlights the rescuing role of AChE-R as being, together with mitochondrial activity, involved in cholinergic adaptation to low doses of Abeta.},

abstract = {ChAT (choline acetyltransferase) is the enzyme responsible for acetylcholine synthesis and is specifically expressed in cholinergic neurons. To further characterize the transcriptional regulation of the hCHAT (human ChAT) gene by NGF, we examined the effects upon ChAT promoter activity of a family of transcription factors which are activated by NGF and several extracellular stimuli and encoded by immediate-early genes. These include NGFI-A (Egr1, zif268), NGFI-C (Egr2), Krox-20 and NGFI-B (Nurr77). Two fragments of the hChAT gene were used for functional analysis carrying 944 bp (P1) and 4000 bp (P1 + P2) of the 5' flanking region in front of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. They were transiently co-transfected with NGFI-A, NGFI-C, Krox-20 and NGFI-B expression vectors in NG108-15, SN6 and COS-1 cells. CAT activity after transfection of the p4000 ChAT-CAT reporter into both neuronal cell lines (NG108-15 and SN6 cells) was increased up to 5-fold in the presence of co-transfected NGFI-A and up to 5- and 12-fold after co-transfection of NGFI-C expression vector in NG108-15 and SN6 cells, respectively. In NG108-15 cells, dbcAMP excerted a strong enhancing activity on the transactivation properties of NGFI-C while this was not observed when cells were transfected with NGFI-A. These trans-activation effects were specific for neuronal cells. When NG108-15 cells were treated with dbcAMP in the presence of H89, a specific PKA inhibitor, the increase of transcriptional activity of NGFI-C was abolished, indicating that a signalling transduction mechanism through PKA plays a role in NGFI-C-induced trans-activation. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays showed that the sequence GCCCGGGGAG (NGFRE) located 1205 bp upstream of the first coding ATG (E1) can bind NGFI-A but not NGFI-C. Several possibilities explaining the observed results are discussed. Finally, transfections of ChAT-CAT reporters including the P1 + P2 region or a minimal ChAT enhancer present in the P2 region in front of a heterologous promoter indicated the presence of a regulatory element which conferred AP2-dependent trans-activation with homologous as well as with heterologous promoter constructs.},
annote = {the most devastating dementia form in the elderly, Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been shown to have the earliest and most severe pathologic changes in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, leading to progressive memory loss and other cognitive decline (Eustache et al., 2001). The hippocampal cholinergic hypofunction has been implicated in progressive memory deficits with both normal aging and AD (Schliebs and Arendt, 2006). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown.


Our recent studies discovered that a functional deficiency of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 (GRK5) occurs in early AD, which may be related to the hippocampal cholinergic dysfunctions (Suo et al., 2007, 2004). Previous studies have attributed decrements in memory associated with AD to postsynaptic M1 muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (mAChR) and nicotinic hypofunction (Kihara and Shimohama, 2004; Ladner et al., 1995; Schliebs and Arendt, 2006).


HT4 hippocampal neurons are capable of mimicking short- and long- term potentiation (LTP) and have therefore been proposed as a good model for memory-related studies (Morimoto and Koshland, 1990).


HT22 cells, a sub-line cloned from their parent HT4 cells, have been more widely used (Aminova et al., 2005; Caldwell et al., 2007; Davis and Maher, 1994; Li et al., 1997, 1998; Lin and Takemoto, 2007; Luo and DeFranco, 2006; Panee et al., 2007; Suo et al., 2003)},

We found that changing a single miRNA-target interaction can simultaneously affect multiple other miRNA-target interactions and modify physiological phenotype. We show that miR-608 targets acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and demonstrate weakened miR-608 interaction with the rs17228616 AChE allele having a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). In cultured cells, this weakened interaction potentiated miR-608-mediated suppression of other targets, including CDC42 and interleukin-6 (IL6). Postmortem human cortices homozygote for the minor rs17228616 allele showed AChE elevation and CDC42/IL6 decreases compared with major allele homozygotes. Additionally, minor allele heterozygote and homozygote subjects showed reduced cortisol and elevated blood pressure, predicting risk of anxiety and hypertension. Parallel suppression of the conserved brain CDC42 activity by intracerebroventricular ML141 injection caused acute anxiety in mice. We demonstrate that SNPs in miRNA-binding regions could cause expanded downstream effects changing important biological pathways.},

abstract = {Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2/NFE2L2), a redox-sensitive transcription factor plays a critical role in adaptation to cellular stress and affords cellular defense by initiating transcription of antioxidative and detoxification genes. While a protein can be regulated at multiple levels, control of Nrf2 has been largely studied at post-translational regulation points by Keap1. Importantly, post-transcriptional/translational based regulation of Nrf2 is less understood and to date there are no reports on such mechanisms in neuronal systems. In this context, studies involving the role of microRNAs (miRs) which are normally considered as fine tuning regulators of protein production through translation repression and/or post-transcriptional alterations, are in place. In the current study, based on in-silico analysis followed by immunoblotting and real time analysis, we have identified and validated for the first time that human NFE2L2 could be targeted by miR153/miR27a/miR142-5p/miR144 in neuronal, SH-SY5Y cells. Co-transfection studies with individual miR mimics along with either WT 3' UTR of human Nrf2 or mutated miRNA targeting seed sequence within Nrf2 3' UTR, demonstrated that Nrf2 is a direct regulatory target of these miRs. In addition, ectopic expression of miR153/miR27a/miR142-5p/miR144 affected Nrf2 mRNA abundance and nucleo-cytoplasmic concentration of Nrf2 in a Keap1 independent manner resulting in inefficient transactivating ability of Nrf2. Furthermore, forced expression of miRs diminished GCLC and GSR expression resulting in alteration of Nrf2 dependent redox homeostasis. Finally, bioinformatics based miRNA-disease network analysis (MDN) along with extended computational network analysis of Nrf2 associated pathologic processes suggests that if in a particular cellular scenario where any of these miR153/miR27a/miR142-5p/miR144 either individually or as a group is altered, it could affect Nrf2 thus triggering and/or determining the fate of wide range of disease outcomes.},

A function test combining the pre-treatment of 1.5 mg dexamethasone (DEX) with a challenge of 100 $\mu$g corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) reveals a pathological increase in the adrenocorticotropin and cortisol release in patients with major depression. These changes partially persist after successful treatment with remission and therefore, might represent trait or vulnerability markers. To further address this question, we were investigating the premorbid neuroendocrine profile of 74 healthy high-risk probands (HRPs) with a positive family history for affective disorders. The aim was to identify premorbid vulnerability factors. During the observation period, 19 HRPs developed an affective disorder. Their premorbid DEX/CRH test results were compared with 19 age- and sex matched controls. No significant differences could be observed between these two groups. Our results suggest that a dysregulated HPA system indicated by this function test can rather be regarded as a neurobiological scar developing during the course of affective disorders. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {studies investigated its role in osteoblasts, but up to now, the involvement of theNNCS in human osteoclastogenesis remains relatively unclear. Thus, aim of the present study was to determine whether the application of acetylcholine (ACh, 10-4 M), nicotine (10-6 M), mineralized collagen membranes or brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, 40 ng/mL) influences the mRNA regulation of molecular components of the NNCS and the neurotrophin family during osteoclastogenesis. Peripheral bloodmononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the blood of young healthy donors (n=8) and incubated with bone fragments and osteoclast differentiation media for 21 days. All the results are based on the measurement of RNA. Real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated a down-regulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit $\alpha$2 andmuscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) M3by osteoclastogenesis while BDNFmRNA expressionwas not regulated. Application of ACh, nicotine, BDNF or collagen membranes did not affect osteoclastic differentiation. No regulation was detected for nAChR subunit $\alpha$7, tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB), and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Taken together, we assume that the transcriptional level of osteoclastogenesis of healthy young humans is not regulated by BDNF, ACh, and nicotine. Thus, these drugs do not seem to worsen bone degradation and might therefore be suitable as modulators of bone substitution materials if having a positive effect on bone formation.},

Searching for the developmental implications of this programming, we manipulated specific acetylcholinesterase (AChE) splice variants in the embryonic mouse brain. In wild type mice, 'synaptic' AChE-S appeared in migrating neurons, whereas the C-terminus cleaved off the stress-induced AChE-R variant associated with migratory radial glial fibers. Antisense suppression of AChE-R reduced neuronal migration, allowing increased proliferation of progenitor cells. In contrast, transgenic overexpression of AChE-R was ineffective, whereas transgenic excess of enzymatically active AChE-S or inactive AChE-Sin suppressed progenitors proliferation alone or both proliferation and neuronal migration, respectively. Our findings attribute to alternative splicing events an interactive major role in neocortical development.},

abstract = {Microtubule-associated protein tau is known to be hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer disease brain and this abnormal hyperphosphorylation is associated with an inability of tau to promote the assembly of microtubule in the affected neurons. Our previous studies demonstrated that abnormally phosphorylated tau could be dephosphorylated after treatment with alkaline phosphatase, thereby suggesting that the abnormal phosphorylation of tau might in part be the result of a deficiency of the phosphoprotein phosphatase system in patients with Alzheimer disease. In the present study we used 32P-labeled phosphorylase kinase and poly(Glu, Tyr) 4:1 as substrates to measure phosphoprotein phosphatase activities in Alzheimer disease and control brains. The activities of phosphoseryl/phosphothreonyl-protein phosphatase types 1, 2A, 2B, and 2C and of phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatase in frontal gray and white matters from 13 Alzheimer brains were determined and compared with those from 12 age-matched control brains. The activities of type 1 phosphatase and phosphotyrosyl phosphatase in gray matter and of type 2A phosphatase in both gray and white matters were significantly lower in Alzheimer disease brains than in controls. These findings suggest that the hyperphosphorylation of tau in Alzheimer disease brain could result from a protein dephosphorylation defect in vivo. The decrease in the phosphatase activities in Alzheimer disease might also be involved in the formation of beta-amyloid by augmenting the amyloidogenic pathway processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein.},

STDP is widely utilized in models of circuit-level plasticity, development, and learning. However, spike timing is just one of several factors (including firing rate, synaptic cooperativity, and depolarization) that govern plasticity induction, and its relative importance varies across synapses and activity regimes. This review summarizes this broader view of plasticity, including the forms and cellular mechanisms for the spike-timing dependence of plasticity, and, the evidence that spike timing is an important determinant of plasticity in vivo.},

abstract = {Molecular origin(s) of the diverse behavioral responses to anticholinesterases were explored in behaviorally impaired transgenic (Tg) FVB/N mice expressing synaptic human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE-S). Untreated hAChE-S Tg, unlike na{\"{i}}ve FVB/N mice, presented variably intense neuronal overexpression of the alternatively spliced, stress-induced mouse "readthrough" mAChE-R mRNA. Both strains displayed similar diurnal patterns of locomotor activity that were impaired 3 days after a day-to-night switch. However, hAChE-S Tg, but not FVB/N mice responded to the circadian switch with irregular, diverse bursts of increased locomotor activity. In social recognition tests, controls displayed short-term recognition, reflected by decreased exploration of a familiar, compared to a novel juvenile conspecific as well as inverse correlation between social recognition and cortical and hippocampal AChE specific activities. In contrast, transgenics presented poor recognition, retrievable by tetrahydroaminoacridine (tacrine, 1.5 mg kg(-1)). Tacrine's effect was short-lived (24 h) suppression of the abnormal social recognition pattern in transgenics. Efficacy of antisense treatment was directly correlated with AChE-R levels and the severity of the impaired phenotype, being most apparent in transgenics presenting highly abnormal pre-treatment behavior. These findings demonstrate that neuronal AChE-R overproduction is involved in various behavioral impairments and anticholinesterase responses, and point to the antisense strategy as a potential approach for re-establishing cholinergic balance.},

However, some pyrethroids show mixed clinical signs. Mainly Type II pyrethroids cause paresthesia, which is characterized by transient burning/tingling/itching sensation of the exposed skin. Also, it has been suggested that some pyrethroids cause developmental neurotoxicity, but available evidence has been judged to be insufficient. While some pyrethroids have been shown to cause tumors in rodent models, the tumor induction does not appear to reflect a common carcinogenic endpoint for this particular subset of compounds. Analysis of carcinogenic mode of action in some cases provides evidence not relevant in humans. Pyrethroids produce no common teratogenic effects in a particular species based on similarity in structure or mode of insecticidal action.},

Despite their functional importance, the molecular mechanisms of functional maturation and maintenance of these cholinergic neurons after the differentiation stage have not been fully elucidated. This study demonstrates that the LIM homeobox 8 (Lhx8) transcription factor regulates cholinergic function in rat septal cholinergic neurons in primary cultures from E18.5 embryos and in the adult brain. Lhx8 expression modulated tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) expression in septal cholinergic neurons in vitro and in vivo, resulting in regulated acetylcholine release as an index of cholinergic function. In addition, Lhx8 expression and function were regulated by nerve growth factor (NGF), and the effect of NGF was potentiated by Lhx8-induced TrkA expression. Together, our findings suggest that positive feedback regulation between Lhx8, TrkA, and NGF is an important regulatory mechanism for cholinergic functions of the septum.},

An understanding of how this naturally occurring polymorphism affects behavior, anatomy, and cognition in adults is an important first step in linking genetic alterations in the neurotrophin system to definable biological outcomes in humans.

abstract = {The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein localizes in the nucleus both in the nucleoplasm and in matrix-associated multiprotein complexes known as nuclear bodies (NBs). The number and the intensity of PML NBs increase in response to interferon (IFN). Overexpression of PML affects the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus. However, PML has a less powerful antiviral activity against these viruses than the IFN mediator MxA. Here, we show that overexpression of PML, but not that of Mx1 or MxA, leads to a drastic decrease of a complex retrovirus, the human foamy virus (HFV), gene expression. PML represses HFV transcription by complexing the HFV transactivator, Tas, preventing its direct binding to viral DNA. This physical interaction requires the N-terminal region of Tas and the RING finger of PML, but does not necessitate PML localization in NBs. Finally, we show that IFN treatment inhibits HFV replication in wild-type but not in PML-/- cells. These findings point to a role for PML in transcriptional repression and suggest that PML could play a key role in mediating an IFN-induced antiviral state against a complex retrovirus.},

abstract = {Interferons (IFNs) play an important role in immunomodulatory and antiviral functions. IFN-induced necroptosis has been reported in cells deficient in receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), or caspase-8, but the mechanism is largely unknown. Here, we report that the DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors (ZBP1, also known as DAI) is required for both type I ($\beta$) and type II ($\gamma$) IFN-induced necroptosis. We show that L929 fibroblast cells became susceptible to IFN-induced necroptosis when RIPK1, FADD, or Caspase-8 was genetically deleted, confirming the antinecroptotic role of these proteins in IFN signaling. We found that the pronecroptotic signal from IFN stimulation depends on new protein synthesis and identified ZBP1, an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) product, as the de novo synthesized protein that triggers necroptosis in IFN-stimulated cells. The N-terminal domain (ND) of ZBP1 is important for ZBP1–ZBP1 homointeraction, and its RHIM domain in the C-terminal region interacts with RIPK3 to initiate RIPK3-dependent necroptosis. The antinecroptotic function of RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8 in IFN-treated cells is most likely executed by caspase-8-mediated cleavage of RIPK3, since the inhibitory effect on necroptosis was eliminated when the caspase-8 cleavage site in RIPK3 was mutated. ZBP1-mediated necroptosis in IFN-treated cells is likely physiologically relevant, as ZBP1 KO mice were significantly protected against acute systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) induced by TNF + IFN-$\gamma$.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND$\backslash$nFindings from family and twin studies suggest that genetic contributions to psychiatric disorders do not in all cases map to present diagnostic categories. We aimed to identify specific variants underlying genetic effects shared between the five disorders in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS$\backslash$nWe analysed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for the five disorders in 33 332 cases and 27 888 controls of European ancestory. To characterise allelic effects on each disorder, we applied a multinomial logistic regression procedure with model selection to identify the best-fitting model of relations between genotype and phenotype. We examined cross-disorder effects of genome-wide significant loci previously identified for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and used polygenic risk-score analysis to examine such effects from a broader set of common variants. We undertook pathway analyses to establish the biological associations underlying genetic overlap for the five disorders. We used enrichment analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to assess whether SNPs with cross-disorder association were enriched for regulatory SNPs in post-mortem brain-tissue samples. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS$\backslash$nSNPs at four loci surpassed the cutoff for genome-wide significance (p{\textless}5×10−8) in the primary analysis: regions on chromosomes 3p21 and 10q24, and SNPs within two L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunits, CACNA1C and CACNB2. Model selection analysis supported effects of these loci for several disorders. Loci previously associated with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia had variable diagnostic specificity. Polygenic risk scores showed cross-disorder associations, notably between adult-onset disorders. Pathway analysis supported a role for calcium channel signalling genes for all five disorders. Finally, SNPs with evidence of cross-disorder association were enriched for brain eQTL markers. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION$\backslash$nOur findings show that specific SNPs are associated with a range of psychiatric disorders of childhood onset or adult onset. In particular, variation in calcium-channel activity genes seems to have pleiotropic effects on psychopathology. These results provide evidence relevant to the goal of moving beyond descriptive syndromes in psychiatry, and towards a nosology informed by disease cause. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nFUNDING$\backslash$nNational Institute of Mental Health.},

abstract = {Aged individuals with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology by the age of 40 years. The purpose of the current study was to measure age-associated changes in APP processing in 36 individuals with DS (5 months-69 years) and in 26 controls (5 months-100 years). Alpha-secretase significantly decreased with age in DS, particularly in cases over the age of 40 years and was stable in controls. The levels of C-terminal fragments of APP reflecting alpha-secretase processing (CTF-alpha) decreased with age in both groups. In both groups, there was significant increase in beta-secretase activity with age. CTF-beta remained constant with age in controls suggesting compensatory increases in turnover/clearance mechanisms. In DS, young individuals had the lowest CTF-beta levels that may reflect rapid conversion of beta-amyloid (Abeta) to soluble pools or efficient CTF-beta clearance mechanisms. Treatments to slow or prevent AD in the general population targeting secretase activity may be more efficacious in adults with DS if combined with approaches that enhance Abeta degradation and clearance.},

As result, we have witnessed a decade of major discoveries in schizophrenia genetics and the development of genome-wide approaches to the study of copy number variants. These genomic technologies have primarily been applied in populations of European descent. However, more recently both genome-wide association study and copy number variant studies in Asian populations have begun to emerge. In this invited review, we provide concise summaries of the schizophrenia genome-wide association study and copy number variant literature with specific focus on studies conducted in the Japanese population. When applicable, we compare findings observed in the Japanese population with those found in other populations. We conclude with recommendations for future research in schizophrenia genetics, relevant to Japan and beyond.},

abstract = {Neuroinflammation is a common characteristic of several mental health conditions such as major depres-sion, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and schizophrenia (SCHZ). Inflammatory processes trigger and/or further deteriorate mental functions and are regarded as targets for therapeutic drug development. Co-tinine is an alkaloid present in tobacco leaves and the main metabolite of nicotine. Cotinine is safe, non-addictive and has pharmacokinetic properties adequate for therapeutic use. Research has shown that cotinine has antipsy-chotic, anxiolytic, and antidepressant properties and modulates the serotonergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic sys-tems. Consistent with the modulation of these neurotransmitter systems, cotinine behaves as a positive allosteric modulator of the nico-tinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and has anti-inflammatory effects. The decrease in neuroinflammation induced by the stimulation of the cholinergic system seems to be a key element explaining the beneficial effects of cotinine in a diverse range of neurological and psychiatric conditions. This review discusses new evidence of the role of neuroinflammation as a key aspect in bipolar disorder, PTSD and major depression, as well as the potential use of cotinine to reduce neuroinflammation in those conditions.},

abstract = {The cholinoceptive system in the hypothalamus, in particular in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), plays a role in regulating food intake. Neurons in the ARC contain multiple neuropeptides, amines, and neurotransmitters. To study molecular and neurochemical heterogeneity of ARC neurons, we combine single-cell qRT-PCR and single-cell whole transcriptome amplification methods to analyze expression patterns of our hand-picked 60 genes in individual neurons in the ARC. Immunohistochemical and single-cell qRT-PCR analyses show choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-expressing neurons in the ARC. Gene expression patterns are remarkably distinct in each individual cholinergic neuron. Two-thirds of cholinergic neurons express tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) mRNA. A large subset of these Th-positive cholinergic neurons is GABAergic as they express the GABA synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase and vesicular GABA transporter transcripts. Some cholinergic neurons also express the vesicular glutamate transporter transcript gene. POMC and POMC-processing enzyme transcripts are found in a subpopulation of cholinergic neurons. Despite this heterogeneity, gene expression patterns in individual cholinergic cells appear to be highly regulated in a cell-specific manner. In fact, membrane receptor transcripts are clustered with their respective intracellular signaling and downstream targets. This novel population of cholinergic neurons may be part of the neural circuitries that detect homeostatic need for food and control the drive to eat.},

Urethral brush cells express bitter and umami taste receptors and downstream components of the taste transduction cascade; respond to stimulation with bitter (denatonium), umami (monosodium glutamate), and uropathogenic Escherichia coli; and release acetylcholine to communicate with other cells. They are approached by sensory nerve fibers expressing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and intraurethral application of denatonium reflexively increases activity of the bladder detrusor muscle in anesthetized rats.

abstract = {Nerve growth factor (NGF) exerts anti-apoptotic, trophic and differentiating actions on sympathetic neurons and cholinergic cells of the basal forebrain and activates the expression of genes regulating the synthesis and storage of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). We have been studying the intracellular signaling pathways involved in this process. Although, in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, NGF strongly activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, prolonged inhibition of MAPK kinase (MEK) activity by PD98059 or U0126 did not affect the ability of NGF to up-regulate choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) or to increase intracellular ACh levels. In contrast, the treatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, but not with its inactive analogue LY303511, completely abolished the NGF-induced production of ACh. Inhibition of PI3K also eliminated the NGF effect on the intracellular ACh level in primary cultures of septal neurons from E18 mouse embryos. Blocking the PI3K pathway prevented the activation of cholinergic gene expression, as demonstrated in RT/PCR assays and in transient transfections of PC12 cells with cholinergic locus promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. These results indicate that the PI3K pathway, but not the MEK/MAPK pathway, is the mediator of NGF-induced cholinergic differentiation.},

abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key mediator of inflammation. Inhibitors of IL-6 or of its signal transducing receptor gp130 constitute a novel class of anti-inflammatory drugs, which raise great hopes for improved treatments of painful inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. IL-6 and gp130 may enhance pain not only indirectly through their proinflammatory actions but also through a direct action on nociceptors (i.e., on neurons activated by painful stimuli). We found indeed that the IL-6/gp130 ligand-receptor complex induced heat hypersensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. This process was mediated by activation of PKC-delta via Gab1/2/PI(3)K and subsequent regulation of TRPV1, a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. To assess the relevance of this direct pain promoting effect of IL-6, we generated conditional knock-out mice, which lack gp130 specifically in nociceptors, and tested them in models of inflammatory and tumor-induced pain. These mice showed significantly reduced levels of inflammatory and tumor-induced pain but no changes in immune reactions or tumor growth. Our results uncover the significance of gp130 expressed in peripheral pain sensing neurons in the pathophysiology of major clinical pain disorders and suggest their use as novel pain relieving agents in inflammatory and tumor pain.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a class of small RNAs important for the post-transcriptional regulation of numerous biological processes. Their combinatorial mode of function, in which an individual miRNA can target many genes and multiple miRNAs share targets, makes them especially suited for regulating processes and pathways at the “network” level. In particular, miRNAs have recently been implicated in aging which is a complex process known to involve multiple pathways. Findings from genome-wide miRNA expression profiling studies highlight three themes in miRNA function during aging: many miRNAs are differentially expressed, many such miRNAs target known aging-associated pathways, and there are global trends in miRNA expression change over time. In addition, several miRNAs have emerged as potentially coordinating multiple pathways during aging. Elucidating the underlying network structure of genes and miRNAs involved in aging processes promises to advance our understanding of not only aging and associated pathogenesis but also of how miRNAs can connect disparate pathways.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a large and growing public health problem. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid $\beta$ peptides and abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins that are associated with cognitive decline and dementia. Much has been learned about the genomics of AD from linkage analyses and, more recently, genome-wide association studies. Several but not all aspects of the genomic landscape are involved in amyloid $\beta$ metabolism. The moderate concordance of disease among twins suggests other factors, potentially epigenomic factors, are related to AD. We are at the earliest stages of examining the relation of the epigenome to the clinical and pathologic phenotypes that characterize AD. Our literature review suggests that there is some evidence of age-related changes in human brain methylation. Unfortunately, studies of AD have been relatively small with limited coverage of methylation sites and microRNA, let alone other epigenomic marks. We are in the midst of 2 large studies of human brains including coverage of more than 420,000 autosomal cytosine-guanine dinucleotides with the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadArray, and histone acetylation with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. We present descriptive data to help inform other researchers what to expect from these approaches to better design and power their studies. We then discuss future directions to inform on the epigenomic architecture of AD.},

Here, we estimate the proportion of co-expression that is due to shared genetic variance. To do so, we estimated the genetic correlations between each pairwise combination of 2469 transcripts that are highly heritable and expressed in whole blood in 1748 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. We identify 556 pairs with a significant genetic correlation of which 77{\%} are located on different chromosomes, and report 934 expression quantitative trait loci, identified in an independent cohort, with significant effects on both transcripts in a genetically correlated pair. We show significant enrichment for transcription factor control and physical proximity through chromatin interactions as possible mechanisms of shared genetic control. Finally, we construct networks of interconnected transcripts and identify their underlying biological functions. Using genetic correlations to investigate transcriptional co-regulation provides valuable insight into the nature of the underlying genetic architecture of gene regulation.Covariance of gene expression pairs is due to a combination of shared genetic and environmental factors.

Complete loss of miRNA expression in the brain leads to neurodegeneration in several animal models. Evidence from patient material is emerging that miRNA dysregulation could, indeed, contribute to neurodegenerative disorders. The translation of proteins previously implicated in familial forms of disease seems to be under control of miRNAs, and changes in miRNAs might explain how these proteins become affected in sporadic neurodegenerative disease. Thus, miRNAs are moving rapidly center stage as key regulators of neuronal development and function in addition to important contributors to neurodegenerative disorder.},

abstract = {Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and microRNAs (miRs) have emerged as two important epigenetic factors in the regulation of vascular physiology. This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between HDACs and miRs in the hemodynamic modulation of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction. We found that miR-10a has the lowest expression among all examined shear-responsive miRs in ECs under oscillatory shear stress (OS), and a relatively high expression under pulsatile shear stress (PS). PS and OS alter EC miR-10a expression to regulate the expression of its direct target GATA6 and downstream vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1. PS induces the expression, nuclear accumulation, and association of retinoid acid receptor-$\alpha$ (RAR$\alpha$) and retinoid X receptor-$\alpha$ (RXR$\alpha$). RAR$\alpha$ and RXR$\alpha$ serve as a “director” and an “enhancer,” respectively, to enhance RAR$\alpha$ binding to RA-responsive element (RARE) and hence miR-10a expression, thus down-regulating GATA6/VCAM-1 signaling in ECs. In contrast, OS induces associations of “repressors” HDAC-3/5/7 with RAR$\alpha$ to inhibit the RAR$\alpha$-directed miR-10a signaling. The flow-mediated miR-10a expression is regulated by Kr{\"{u}}ppel-like factor 2 through modulation in RAR$\alpha$–RARE binding, with the consequent regulation in GATA6/VCAM-1 in ECs. These results are confirmed in vivo by en face staining on the aortic arch vs. the straight thoracic aorta of rats. Our findings identify a mechanism by which HDACs and RXR$\alpha$ modulate the hormone receptor RAR$\alpha$ to switch miR-10a expression and hence the proinflammatory vs. anti-inflammatory responses of vascular endothelium under different hemodynamic forces.},

abstract = {Obesity is one of the major risk factors for asthma. Previous studies have demonstrated that free fatty acid levels are elevated in the plasma of obese individuals. Medium- and long-chain free fatty acids act as endogenous ligands for the free fatty acid receptors FFAR1/GPR40 and FFAR4/GPR120, which couple to Gq proteins. We investigated whether FFAR1 and FFAR4 are expressed on airway smooth muscle and whether they activate Gq-coupled signaling and modulate airway smooth muscle tone. We detected the protein expression of FFAR1 and FFAR4 in freshly dissected native human and guinea pig airway smooth muscle and cultured human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. The long-chain free fatty acids (oleic acid and linoleic acid) and GW9508 (FFAR1/FFAR4 dual agonist) dose-dependently stimulated transient intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) increases and inositol phosphate synthesis in HASM cells. Downregulation of FFAR1 or FFAR4 in HASM cells by small interfering RNA led to a significant inhibition of the long-chain free fatty acids-induced transient [Ca(2+)]i increases. Oleic acid, linoleic acid, or GW9508 stimulated stress fiber formation in HASM cells, potentiated acetylcholine-contracted guinea pig tracheal rings, and attenuated the relaxant effect of isoproterenol after an acetylcholine-induced contraction. In contrast, TUG-891 (FFAR4 agonist) did not induce the stress fiber formation or potentiate acetylcholine-induced contraction. These results suggest that FFAR1 is the functionally dominant free fatty acid receptor in both human and guinea pig airway smooth muscle. The free fatty acid sensors expressed on airway smooth muscle could be an important modulator of airway smooth muscle tone.},

In humans, Ago2 is responsible for the endonuclease cleavage of targeted mRNA and it interacts with the mRNA-binding protein GW182, which is a marker for cytoplasmic foci referred to as GW bodies (GWBs). We demonstrated that the anti-Ago2 monoclonal antibody 4F9 recognized GWBs in a cell cycle dependent manner and was capable of capturing miRNAs associated with Ago2. Since Ago2 protein is the effector protein of RNAi, anti-Ago2 monoclonal antibody may be useful in capturing functional miRNAs.},

Here, we identify hundreds of targets eligible for TDMD and show that an endogenous RNA (Serpine1) controls the degradation of two miRNAs (miR-30b-5p and miR-30c-5p) in mouse fibroblasts. In our study, TDMD occurs when the target is expressed at relatively low levels, similar in range to those of its miRNAs (100-200 copies per cell), and becomes more effective at high target:miRNA ratios ({\textgreater}10:1). We employ CRISPR/Cas9 to delete the miR-30 responsive element within Serpine1 3'UTR and interfere with TDMD. TDMD suppression increases miR-30b/c levels and boosts their activity towards other targets, modulating gene expression and cellular phenotypes (i.e., cell cycle re-entry and apoptosis). In conclusion, a sophisticated regulatory layer of miRNA and gene expression mediated by specific endogenous targets exists in mammalian cells.},

However, hippocampus and striatum can also be engaged to function in parallel as part of a dynamic system to integrate previous experience and adjust behavioral responses. In these structures the formation, storage, and retrieval of memory require a synaptic mechanism that is able to integrate multiple signals and to translate them into persistent molecular traces at both the corticostriatal and hippocampal/limbic synapses. The best cellular candidate for this complex synthesis is represented by long-term potentiation (LTP). A common feature of LTP expressed in these two memory systems is the critical requirement of convergence and coincidence of glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs to the dendritic spines of the neurons expressing this form of synaptic plasticity. In experimental models of Parkinson's disease abnormal accumulation of $\alpha$-synuclein affects these two memory systems by altering two major synaptic mechanisms underlying cognitive functions in cholinergic striatal neurons, likely implicated in basal ganglia dependent operative memory, and in the CA1 hippocampal region, playing a central function in episodic/declarative memory processes.},

Individual arbors were observed to span multiple cortical columns, and to have {\textgreater}1000 branch points and total axon lengths up to 50 cm.

abstract = {Eosinophils are observed to localize to cholinergic nerves in a variety of inflammatory conditions such as asthma, rhinitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, where they are also responsible for the induction of cell signaling. We hypothesized that a consequence of eosinophil localization to cholinergic nerves would involve a neural remodeling process. Eosinophil co-culture with cholinergic IMR32 cells led to increased expression of the M2 muscarinic receptor, with this induction being mediated via an adhesion-dependent release of eosinophil proteins, including major basic protein and nerve growth factor. Studies on the promoter sequence of the M2 receptor indicated that this induction was initiated at a transcription start site 145 kb upstream of the gene-coding region. This promoter site contains binding sites for a variety of transcription factors including SP1, AP1, and AP2. Eosinophils also induced the expression of several cholinergic genes involved in the synthesis, storage, and metabolism of acetylcholine, including the enzymes choline acetyltransferase, vesicular acetylcholine transferase, and acetylcholinesterase. The observed eosinophil-induced changes in enzyme content were associated with a reduction in intracellular neural acetylcholine but an increase in choline content, suggesting increased acetylcholine turnover and a reduction in acetylcholinesterase activity, in turn suggesting reduced catabolism of acetylcholine. Together these data suggest that eosinophil localization to cholinergic nerves induces neural remodeling, promoting a cholinergic phenotype.},

abstract = {The cardinal dogma of central nervous system (CNS) immunology believed brain is an immune privileged site, but scientific evidences gathered so far have overturned this notion proving that CNS is no longer an immune privileged site, but rather an actively regulated site of immune surveillance. Landmark discovery of lymphatic system surrounding the duramater of the brain, made possible by high resolution live imaging technology has given new dimension to neuro-immunology. Here, we discuss the immune privilege status of CNS in light of the previous and current findings, taking into account the differences between a healthy state and changes that occur during an inflammatory response. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) along with interstitial fluid (ISF) drain activated T cells, natural killer cells, macrophages and dendritic cells from brain to regional lymph nodes present in the head and neck region. To keep an eye on inflammation, this system hosts an army of regulatory T cells (CD25+ FoxP3+) that regulate T cell hyper activation, proliferation and cytokine production. This review is an attempt to fill the gaps in our understanding of neuroimmune interactions, role of innate and adaptive immune system in maintaining homeostasis, interplay of different immune cells, immune tolerance, knowledge of communication pathways between the CNS and the peripheral immune system and lastly how interruption of immune surveillance leads to neurodegenerative diseases. We envisage that discoveries should be made not only to decipher underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of immune trafficking, but should aid in identifying targeted cell populations for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders.},

Neurons with choline acetyltransferase-like immunoreactivity were seen in the striatal complex, in the septal area, in the diagonal band region, in the substantia innominata, in the medial habenula, in the pontomecencephalic tegmentum and in the occulomotor and trochlear nuclei. The ventral striatum contained a higher density of cholinergic cell bodies than the dorsal striatum. All of the structures that contained the choline acetyltransferase positive neurons also had acetylcholinesterase-rich neurons. Choline acetyltransferase positive neurons were not encountered in the cortex. Some perikarya in the midline, intralaminar, reticular and limbic thalamic nuclei as well as in the hypothalamus were rich in acetylcholinesterase but did not give a positive choline acetyltransferase reaction. A similar dissociation was observed in the substantia nigra, the raphe nuclei and the nucleus locus coeruleus where acetylcholinesterase-rich neurons appeared to lack perikaryal choline acetyltransferase activity. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

Further study of these nerves with the electron microscope revealed (i) a sprouting response of nonmedullated axons, (ii) the appearance of fine axons with a few turns of compact myclin, (iii) abnormal contracts of axons with basal laminae, with fibroblast-like cells, and between them, (iv) the occurrence of hemidesmosome- and desmosome-like junctions between Schwann cell processes, and between Schwann cells and axons, and (v) the appearance of amorphous and fibrillary extracellular deposits alongside the axolemma. The adjacent proximal and distal segments were normal, i.e., axons remained continuous, and the alterations were confined to the segment exposed to the protease inhibitors. Heated APP Kappa APP without the Kunitz insert (APP K-), bovine serum albumin, and saline, did not elicit cytological alterations. Our results suggest that these inhibitors of serine proteases (i) set free a sprouting drive of axons by disrupting an ongoing repressive mechanism: (ii) modify the adhesive properties of axons and Schwann cells, and (iii) alter the natural history of an extracellular material. The imbalance of an extracellular protease system may participate in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.},

Recently, fragments derived from tRNA, named as tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA), have attracted broad attention. There are mainly two types of tsRNAs, including tRNA-derived stress-induced RNA (tiRNA) and tRNA-derived fragment (tRF), which differ in the cleavage position of the precursor or mature tRNA transcript. Emerging evidence has shown that tsRNAs are not merely tRNA degradation debris but have been recognized to play regulatory roles in many specific physiological and pathological processes. In this review, we summarize the biogeneses of various tsRNAs, present the emerging concepts regarding functions and mechanisms of action of tsRNAs, highlight the potential application of tsRNAs in human diseases, and put forward the current problems and future research directions.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by repressing translation of target cellular transcripts. Increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs have distinct expression profiles and play crucial roles in numerous cellular processes, although the extent of miRNA regulation is not well known. By challenging mice with lentiviral vectors encoding target sequences of endogenous miRNAs, we show the efficiency of miRNAs in sharply segregating gene expression among different tissues. Transgene expression from vectors incorporating target sequences for mir-142-3p was effectively suppressed in intravascular and extravascular hematopoietic lineages, whereas expression was maintained in nonhematopoietic cells. This expression profile, which could not be attained until now, enabled stable gene transfer in immunocompetent mice, thus overcoming a major hurdle to successful gene therapy. Our results provide novel in situ evidence of miRNA regulation and demonstrate a new paradigm in vector design with applications for genetic engineering and therapeutic gene transfer.},

abstract = {The nucleus basalis is located at the confluence of the limbic and reticular activating systems. It receives dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra, serotonergic input from the raphe nuclei, and noradrenergic input from the nucleus locus coeruleus. Its cholinergic contingent, known as Ch4, provides the principal source of acetylcholine for the cerebral cortex and amygdala. More than half of presynaptic varicosities along its cholinergic axons make traditional synaptic contacts with cortical neurons. Limbic and paralimbic cortices of the brain receive the heaviest cholinergic input from Ch4 and are also the principal sources of reciprocal cortical projections back to the nucleus basalis. This limbic affiliation explains the role of the nucleus basalis in modulating the impact and memorability of incoming sensory information. The anatomical continuity of the nucleus basalis with other basomedial limbic structures may underlie its early and high vulnerability to the tauopathy and neurofibrillary degeneration of Alzheimer's disease. The tauopathy in Ch4 eventually leads to the degeneration of the cholinergic axons that it sends to the cerebral cortex. The early involvement of Ch4 has a magnifying effect on Alzheimer's pathology, because neurofibrillary degeneration in a small number of neurons can perturb neurotransmission in all cortical areas. Although the exact contribution of the Ch4 lesion to the cognitive changes of Alzheimer's disease remains poorly understood, the cholinergic circuitry of the nucleus basalis is emerging as one of the most strategically positioned and behaviorally consequential modulatory systems of the human cerebral cortex.

abstract = {Acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), acting through muscarinic receptors, has an essential role in regulating flexible behavior and working memory (WM). General muscarinic receptor blockade disrupts PFC WM representations, while selective stimulation of muscarinic receptor subtypes is of great interest for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we tested selective stimulation and blockade of muscarinic M1 receptors (M1Rs) in macaque PFC, during performance of a cognitive control task in which rules maintained in WM specified saccadic responses. We hypothesized that M1R blockade and stimulation would disrupt and enhance rule representation in WM, respectively. Unexpectedly, M1R blockade did not consistently affect PFC neuronal rule selectivity. Moreover, M1R stimulation suppressed PFC activity, and at higher doses, degraded rule representations. Our results suggest that, in primates, the deleterious effects of general muscarinic blockade on PFC WM activity are not mediated by M1Rs, while their overstimulation deteriorates PFC rule maintenance. Vijayraghavan et al. report that muscarinic M1 receptor blockade did not reproduce the effects of general muscarinic antagonism on maintenance of behavioral rules in prefrontal cortical neurons. M1 receptor stimulation consistently inhibited prefrontal neurons and overstimulation disrupted maintenance of rules.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that adenosine, acting via the A1 receptor, is a key factor in the homeostatic control of sleep. The increase in extracellular levels of adenosine during prolonged wakefulness is thought to facilitate the transition to sleep by reducing the discharge activity of wakefulness-promoting neurons in the basal forebrain. Adenosine A1 receptor control of the homeostatic regulation of sleep was tested by microdialysis perfusion of antisense oligonucleotides against the mRNA of the A1 receptor in the magnocellular cholinergic region of the basal forebrain of freely behaving rats. After microdialysis perfusion of A1 receptor antisense in the basal forebrain, spontaneous levels of sleep-wakefulness showed a significant reduction in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with an increase in wakefulness. After 6 hr of sleep deprivation, the antisense-treated animals spent a significantly reduced amount of time in non-REM sleep, with postdeprivation recovery sleep hours 2-5 showing a reduction of approximately 50-60{\%}. There was an even greater postdeprivation reduction in delta power (60-75{\%}) and a concomitant increase in wakefulness. All behavioral state changes returned to control (baseline) values after the cessation of antisense administration. Control experiments with microdialysis perfusion of nonsense (randomized antisense) oligonucleotides and with artificial CSF showed no effect during postdeprivation recovery sleep or spontaneously occurring behavioral states. Antisense to the A1 receptor suppressed A1 receptor immunoreactivity but did not show any neurotoxicity as visualized by Fluoro-Jade staining. These data support our hypothesis that adenosine, acting via the A1 receptor, in the basal forebrain is a key component in the homeostatic regulation of sleep.},

Traverse, P. Cohen, Identification of a MAP kinase in phaeochromocytoma (PC12) cells, FEBS Lett. 314 (1992) 461-465 [4]). The use of such systems provides an inexpensive, quick and simple way to identify and test molecules that can be further studied in more complex in vivo experiments. Some cell lines such as embryonic stem cells can be induced to differentiate in vitro, however, the differentiation is difficult to control and most often leads to the generation of a wide variety of cell types. Cell lines derived from sources committed to a restricted cell fate provide an opportunity to examine cell growth and differentiation within a specific cell type (G.M. Keller, In vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 7 (1995) 862-869 [10]). In this article we describe a simple system for the differentiation of the human neuroblastoma cell line LA-N-5 into cholinergic neurons using all-trans retinoic acid (G. Han, B. Chang, M.J.

Kreutzberg, Regulation of acetylcholinesterase activity by retinoic acid in a human neuroblastoma cell line, Exp. Cell Res. 155 (1984) 305-309 [14]). These cells provide a setting for the study of cholinergic neuronal differentiation and of the factors that influence that process.

abstract = {For many years, neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus were thought to contain the unique mammalian clock controlling circadian rhythmicity of peripheral tissues via neural and humoral signals. Surprisingly, the cloning and characterisation of mammalian clock genes have revealed that they are expressed in a circadian manner throughout the body. It is generally accepted now that peripheral cells contain a circadian clock which is similar to the one present in SCN neurons, although only the latter seems to be self-sustained. It is still unclear how these peripheral clocks are synchronised by the central SCN clock, albeit humoral signals appear to be crucial. Interestingly, peripheral clocks can be uncoupled from the central clock in particular conditions such as restricted-feeding, allowing peripheral tissues to adapt themselves to cues incompatible to other cues perceived by the SCN (mainly the photoperiod). Whereas circadian clocks have been intensively dissected, little is known about the mechanisms by which these clocks regulate the expression of clock-controlled genes. Direct regulation for some of them by the products of clock genes was recently documented, but this probably represents the exception rather than the rule. We should soon be able to describe complete circadian transcriptional cascades from clock genes to enzymes and structural proteins. In addition to circadian humoral and neural signals, these cascades should help us to understand how gene expression, physiology and behaviour are influenced by the rotation of the Earth around its axis.},

LncRNAs exhibit cell type- and tissue-specific expression, but little is known about the expression and function of lncRNAs in the developing human brain. Furthermore, it has been unclear whether lncRNAs are highly expressed in subsets of cells within tissues, despite appearing lowly expressed in bulk populations. We use strand-specific RNA-seq to deeply profile lncRNAs from polyadenylated and total RNA obtained from human neocortex at different stages of development, and we apply this reference to analyze the transcriptomes of single cells. While lncRNAs are generally detected at low levels in bulk tissues, single-cell transcriptomics of hundreds of neocortex cells reveal that many lncRNAs are abundantly expressed in individual cells and are cell type-specific. Notably, LOC646329 is a lncRNA enriched in single radial glia cells but is detected at low abundance in tissues. CRISPRi knockdown of LOC646329 indicates that this lncRNA regulates cell proliferation. The discrete and abundant expression of lncRNAs among individual cells has important implications for both their biological function and utility for distinguishing neural cell types.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent an important class of small regulatory RNAs that control gene expression posttranscriptionally by targeting mRNAs for degradation or translation inhibition. Early studies have revealed a complex role for miRNAs in major biological processes such as development, differentiation, growth and metabolism. MiR-137 in particular, has been of great interest due to its critical role in brain function and putative involvement in the etiology of both neuropsychiatric disorders and cancer. Several lines of evidence suggest that development, differentiation and maturation of the nervous system is strongly linked to the expression of miR-137 and its regulation of a large number of downstream target genes in various pathways. Dysregulation of this molecule has also been implicated in major mental illnesses through its position in a variant allele highly associated with schizophrenia in the largest mega genome-wide association studies. Interestingly, miR-137 has also been shown to act as a tumor suppressor, with numerous studies finding reduced expression in neoplasia including brain tumor. Restoration of miR-137 expression has also been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, migration and metastasis, and induce cell cycle arrest, differentiation and apoptosis. These properties of miR-137 propose its potential for prognosis, diagnosis and as a therapeutic target for treatment of several human neurological and neoplastic disorders. In this review, we provide details on the discovery, targets, function, regulation and disease involvement of miR-137 with a broad look at recent discovery in this area.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 13 September 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2016.150.},

These cells expressed at their surface both nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors, revealed by [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin and [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate ([3H]QNB) binding, respectively. [125I]alpha-Bungarotoxin binding was efficiently inhibited by alpha-bungarotoxin, nicotine, carbachol, and d-tubocurarine. [3H]QNB binding was competitively inhibited by atropine, pirenzepine, and carbachol. Hexamethonium did not affect the binding of either ligand. In competition experiments with [3H]QNB, pirenzepine recognized only one binding site with "low affinity," and carbachol recognized two sites with different affinities. beta-adrenergic receptors were present in a very low amount, whereas alpha-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors were not detectable. IMR32 cells had an imipramine-sensitive [3H]dopamine uptake, but carbachol, high levels of K+, the calcium ionophore A23187, and alpha-latrotoxin were not able to induce release of [3H]dopamine that had been taken up. The ultrastructural analysis showed that IMR32 cells contained very few dense-core vesicles, suggesting a low storage capacity for neurotransmitter. These cells could be an useful in vitro model for studying neurotransmitter receptors of the human CNS.},

@article{Langfelder2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Chronic neuropathic pain is an unfavourable pathological pain characterised by allodynia and hyperalgesia which has brought considerable trouble to people's physical and mental health, but effective therapeutics are still lacking. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been widely studied in the development of neuropathic pain and neuronal inflammation. Among various miRNAs, miR-155 has been widely studied. It is intensively involved in regulating inflammation-associated diseases. However, the role of miR-155 in regulating neuropathic pain development is poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether miR-155 is associated with neuropathic pain and delineate the underlying mechanism. Using a neuropathic pain model of chronic constriction injury (CCI), miR-155 expression levels were markedly increased in the spinal cord. Inhibition of miR-155 significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia and proinflammatory cytokine expression. We also demonstrated that miR-155 directly bound with the 3′-untranslated region of the suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1). The expression of SOCS1 significantly decreased in the CCI rat model, but this effect could be reversed by miR-155 inhibition. Furthermore, knockdown of SOCS1 abroga ted the inhibitory effects of miR-155 inhibition on neuropathic development and neuronal inflammation. Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of miR-155 resulted in the suppression of nuclear factor-$\kappa$B and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by mediating SOCS1. Our data demonstrate the critical role of miR-155 in regulating neuropathic pain through SOCS1, and suggest that miR-155 may be an important and potential target in preventing neuropathic pain development.},

Northern blot analysis consists of resolving RNAs by gel electrophoresis, followed by transferring and fixing to nylon membranes as well as detecting by hybridization with radioactive probes. Earlier efforts to improve this method focused mainly on altering the sensitivity of short RNA detection. We have enhanced the resolution of the northern blot technique by optimizing the electrophoresis step. We have also investigated other steps of the procedure with the goal of enhancing the resolution of RNAs; herein, we present several recommendations to do so. Our protocol is applicable to analyses of all kinds of endogenous and exogenous RNAs, falling within length ranges of 20-30 and 50-70 nt, corresponding to microRNA and pre-microRNA lengths, respectively.},

Accumulating research indicates that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), are increasingly being implicated in AD. MiRNAs are conserved small ncRNAs that control gene expression post-transcriptionally while lncRNAs function in many ways. Recent profiling research in human or mouse models suggests that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in AD, and these have been implicated in the regulation of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide, tau, inflammation, cell death, and other aspects which are the main pathomechanisms of AD. In addition, regulation of miRNAs varies in blood, and cerebral spinal fluid may indicate alterations in AD. Together with brain-specific miRNAs, these miRNAs could be potential AD biomarkers. All the above may provide the basis for new approaches for AD. Here, we review current findings regarding ncRNA research in human and mouse models to provide a strong basis for future study aiming at promising contributions of ncRNA in AD.},

abstract = {tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs) are 18–26 nu-cleotide small RNAs that are not random degradation products, but are rather specifically cleaved from ma-ture tRNA transcripts. Abundant in stressed or viral-infected cells, the function and potential targets of tRFs are not known. We identified that in the un-stressed wild-type male gamete containing pollen of flowering plants, and analogous reproductive struc-ture in non-flowering plant species, tRFs accumu-late to high levels. In the reference plant Arabidop-sis thaliana, tRFs are processed by Dicer-like 1 and incorporated into Argonaute1 (AGO1), akin to a mi-croRNA. We utilized the fact that many plant small RNAs direct cleavage of their target transcripts to demonstrate that the tRF–AGO1 complex acts to specifically target and cleave endogenous transpos-able element (TE) mRNAs produced from transcrip-tionally active TEs. The data presented here demon-strate that tRFs are bona-fide regulatory microRNA-like small RNAs involved in the regulation of genome stability through the targeting of TE transcripts.},

abstract = {We have previously demonstrated that interleukin 3 (IL-3) has a neurotrophic effect on central cholinergic neurons and have demonstrated the presence of IL-3 receptor (IL-3R)beta subunits in septal cholinergic neurons by reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. In order to confirm that the expressed IL-3R is functional, we conducted experiments to show an alpha subunit of IL-3R. The alpha subunit was clearly demonstrated by RT-PCR in the central cholinergic neuronal hybrid cell line SN6, but not in its mother cell line N18TG2, and the expression was slightly upregulated after IL-3 treatment. Choline acetyltransferase and vesicular acetylcholine transporter mRNAs were significantly increased in SN6 after treatment with IL-3. Immunohistochemically, IL-3R alpha-positive cells were mainly present in the medial septal and basal forebrain region, and the stained cells were similar to choline acetyltransferase-positive cells in shape and distribution. The IL-3R alpha-positive cells slightly increased two days after fimbria-fornix transection and decreased seven days after. These findings suggest that functional IL-3 receptors are expressed in the central cholinergic neurons and contribute to some physiological roles such as the differentiation and maintenance of these neurons.},

Therefore, neurotrophic factor issue has been extensively investigated into the context of neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease show changes in the regulation of specific neurotrophic factors and their receptors, which appear to be critical for neuronal degeneration. Indeed, neurotrophic factors prevent cell death in degenerative processes and can enhance the growth and function of affected neurons in these disorders. Based on recent reports, this review discusses the main findings related to the neurotrophic factor support - mainly brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor - in the survival, proliferation and maturation of affected neurons in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease as well as their putative application as new therapeutic approach for these diseases management.},

abstract = {Learning from novel experiences is a major task of the central nervous system. In mammals, the medial temporal lobe is crucial for this rapid form of learning. The modification of synapses and neuronal circuits through plasticity is thought to underlie memory formation. The induction of synaptic plasticity is favoured by coordinated action-potential timing across populations of neurons. Such coordinated activity of neural populations can give rise to oscillations of different frequencies, recorded in local field potentials. Brain oscillations in the theta frequency range (3-8 Hz) are often associated with the favourable induction of synaptic plasticity as well as behavioural memory. Here we report the activity of single neurons recorded together with the local field potential in humans engaged in a learning task. We show that successful memory formation in humans is predicted by a tight coordination of spike timing with the local theta oscillation. More stereotyped spiking predicts better memory, as indicated by higher retrieval confidence reported by subjects. These findings provide a link between the known modulation of theta oscillations by many memory-modulating behaviours and circuit mechanisms of plasticity.},

abstract = {The brain, endocrine, and immune systems are inextricably linked. Immune molecules have a powerful impact on neuroendocrine function, including hormone-behavior interactions, during health as well as sickness. Similarly, alterations in hormones, such as during stress, can powerfully impact immune function or reactivity. These functional shifts are evolved, adaptive responses that organize changes in behavior and mobilize immune resources, but can also lead to pathology or exacerbate disease if prolonged or exaggerated. The developing brain in particular is exquisitely sensitive to both endogenous and exogenous signals, and increasing evidence suggests the immune system has a critical role in brain development and associated behavioral outcomes for the life of the individual. Indeed, there are associations between many neuropsychiatric disorders and immune dysfunction, with a distinct etiology in neurodevelopment. The goal of this review is to describe the important role of the immune system during brain development, and to discuss some of the many ways in which immune activation during early brain development can affect the later-life outcomes of neural function, immune function, mood and cognition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Recent efforts have revealed the microRNA (miRNA) pathways in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epidemiological studies have revealed an association between folic acid deficiency and AD risk. However, the effects of folic acid deficiency on miRNA expression in AD animals have not been observed. We aimed to find if folic acid deficiency may enhance amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide deposition and regulate amyloid-associated miRNAs and their target genes expression in APP/PS1 mice. APP/PS1 mice and N2a cells were treated with folic acid-deficient diet or medium. Cognitive function of mice was assessed using the Morris water maze. miRNA profile was tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array. Different expressional miRNAs were validated by real-time PCR. The deposition of A$\beta$ plaques was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. APP and BACE1 proteins in mice brain and N2a cells were determined by Western blot. Folic acid deficiency aggravated amyloid pathology in AD mice. The AD+FD group showed shorter time spent in the target zone during the probe test. Analysis of miRNAs predicted to target these genes revealed several miRNA candidates that were differentially modulated by folic acid deficiency. In APP/PS1 mice brains and N2a cells with folic acid-deficient treatment, miR-106a-5p, miR-200b-3p and miR-339-5p were down-regulated, and their target genes APP and BACE1 were up-regulated. In conclusion, folic acid deficiency can enhance A$\beta$ accumulation in APP/PS1 mice brain and decrease amyloid-associated miRNAs expression.},

abstract = {Over 100 loci are now associated with schizophrenia risk as identified by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genome-wide association studies. These findings mean that 'genes for schizophrenia' have unquestionably been found. However, many questions remain unanswered, including several which affect their therapeutic significance. The SNPs individually have minor effects, and even cumulatively explain only a modest fraction of the genetic predisposition. The remainder likely results from many more loci, from rare variants, and from gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. The risk SNPs are almost all non-coding, meaning that their biological significance is unclear; probably their effects are mediated via an influence on gene regulation, and emerging evidence suggests that some key molecular events occur during early brain development. The loci include novel genes of unknown function as well as genes and pathways previously implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, e.g. NMDA receptor signalling. Genes in the latter category have the clearer therapeutic potential, although even this will be a challenging process because of the many complexities concerning the genetic architecture and mediating mechanisms. This review summarises recent schizophrenia genetic findings and some key issues they raise, particularly with regard to their implications for identifying and validating novel drug targets.},

To better understand these two species on a molecular level, we performed a comparison of the expression profiles of 15 tissues by deep RNA sequencing and examined the similarities and differences in the transcriptome for both protein-coding and -noncoding transcripts. Although commonalities are evident in the expression of tissue-specific genes between the two species, the expression for many sets of genes was found to be more similar in different tissues within the same species than between species. These findings were further corroborated by associated epigenetic histone mark analyses. We also find that many noncoding transcripts are expressed at a low level and are not detectable at appreciable levels across individuals. Moreover, the majority lack obvious sequence homologs between species, even when we restrict our attention to those which are most highly reproducible across biological replicates. Overall, our results indicate that there is considerable RNA expression diversity between humans and mice, well beyond what was described previously, likely reflecting the fundamental physiological differences between these two organisms.},

Nevertheless, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that maintain the defining characteristics of neurons following their initial postmitotic specification. Using conditional gene ablation in mice, we demonstrate here that the homeodomain protein LIM homeobox (Lhx)7 is essential for maintaining the morphological and molecular characteristics of cholinergic interneurons of the striatum. Lhx7-depleted cholinergic interneurons extinguish expression of several subtype-specific markers, including choline acetyl transferase and Isl1, and are respecified into Lhx6-expressing mature GABAergic interneurons. Additional expression studies support a model where Lhx7 controls the choice between cholinergic or GABAergic identity by gating a cross inhibitory regulation between Isl1 and Lhx6. By demonstrating that the switch between alternative striatal interneuron fates depends on persistent activity of a single transcription factor, we provide evidence that the intrinsic plasticity of mammalian forebrain neuronal subtypes is maintained after the initial specification and lineage commitment and possibly throughout life.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of non-coding RNAs that are believed to be important in many biological processes through regulation of gene expression. The precise molecular function of miRNAs in mammals is largely unknown and a better understanding will require loss-of-function studies in vivo. Here we show that a novel class of chemically engineered oligonucleotides, termed 'antagomirs', are efficient and specific silencers of endogenous miRNAs in mice. Intravenous administration of antagomirs against miR-16, miR-122, miR-192 and miR-194 resulted in a marked reduction of corresponding miRNA levels in liver, lung, kidney, heart, intestine, fat, skin, bone marrow, muscle, ovaries and adrenals. The silencing of endogenous miRNAs by this novel method is specific, efficient and long-lasting. The biological significance of silencing miRNAs with the use of antagomirs was studied for miR-122, an abundant liver-specific miRNA. Gene expression and bioinformatic analysis of messenger RNA from antagomir-treated animals revealed that the 3' untranslated regions of upregulated genes are strongly enriched in miR-122 recognition motifs, whereas downregulated genes are depleted in these motifs. Analysis of the functional annotation of downregulated genes specifically predicted that cholesterol biosynthesis genes would be affected by miR-122, and plasma cholesterol measurements showed reduced levels in antagomir-122-treated mice. Our findings show that antagomirs are powerful tools to silence specific miRNAs in vivo and may represent a therapeutic strategy for silencing miRNAs in disease.},

abstract = {Sleep regulation involves interdependent signaling among specialized neurons in distributed brain regions. Although acetylcholine promotes wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, it is unclear whether the cholinergic pathway is essential (i.e., absolutely required) for REM sleep because of redundancy from neural circuits to molecules. First, we demonstrate that synaptic inhibition of TrkA+ cholinergic neurons causes a severe short-sleep phenotype and that sleep reduction is mostly attributable to a shortened sleep duration in the dark phase. Subsequent comprehensive knockout of acetylcholine receptor genes by the triple-target CRISPR method reveals that a similar short-sleep phenotype appears in the knockout of two Gq-type acetylcholine receptors Chrm1 and Chrm3. Strikingly, Chrm1 and Chrm3 double knockout chronically diminishes REM sleep to an almost undetectable level. These results suggest that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, Chrm1 and Chrm3, are essential for REM sleep. The acetylcholine pathway has been proposed to be important for wakefulness and REM sleep, but genetic evidence has been missing. Using a knockout of acetylcholine receptor genes, Niwa et al. show that Chrm1 and Chrm3 double knockout chronically diminishes REM sleep to an undetectable level and causes a severe short-sleep phenotype.},

abstract = {The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) can regulate neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system by acting on both the cys-loop ligand-gated nicotinic ACh receptor channels (nAChRs) and the G protein-coupled muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs). The hippocampus is an important area in the brain for learning and memory, where both nAChRs and mAChRs are expressed. The primary cholinergic input to the hippocampus arises from the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca, the activation of which can activate both nAChRs and mAChRs in the hippocampus and regulate synaptic communication and induce oscillations that are thought to be important for cognitive function. Dysfunction in the hippocampal cholinergic system has been linked with cognitive deficits and a variety of neurological disorders and diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. My lab has focused on the role of the nAChRs in regulating hippocampal function, from understanding the expression and functional properties of the various subtypes of nAChRs, and what role these receptors may be playing in regulating synaptic plasticity. Here, I will briefly review this work, and where we are going in our attempts to further understand the role of these receptors in learning and memory, as well as in disease and neuroprotection.},

abstract = {The aims of this review are: 1) to describe which cholinergic neurons are affected in brain neurodegenerative diseases leading to dementia; 2) to discuss the possible causes of the degeneration of the cholinergic neurons, 3) to summarize the functional consequences of the cholinergic deficit. The brain cholinergic system is basically constituted by three populations of phenotypically similar neurons forming a series of basal forebrain nuclei, the midpontine nuclei and a large population of striatal interneurons. In Alzheimer's disease there is an extensive loss of forebrain cholinergic neurons accompanied by a reduction of the cholinergic fiber network of the cortical mantel and hippocampus. The midpontine cholinergic nuclei are spared. The same situation occurs in the corticobasal syndrome and dementia following alcohol abuse and traumatic brain injury. Conversely, in Parkinson's disease, the midpontine nuclei degenerate, together with the dopaminergic nuclei, reducing the cholinergic input to thalamus and forebrain whereas the forebrain cholinergic neurons are spared. In Parkinson's disease with dementia, Lewis Body Dementia and Parkinsonian syndromes both groups of forebrain and midpontine cholinergic nuclei degenerate. In Huntington's disease a dysfunction of the striatal cholinergic interneurons without cell loss takes place. The formation and accumulation of misfolded proteins such as $\beta$-amyloid oligomers and plaques, tau protein tangles and $\alpha$-synuclein clumps, and aggregated mutated huntingtin play a crucial role in the neuronal degeneration by direct cellular toxicity of the misfolded proteins and through the toxic compounds resulting from an extensive inflammatory reaction. Evidences indicate that $\beta$-amyloid disrupts NGF metabolism causing the degeneration of the cholinergic neurons which depend on NGF for their survival, namely the forebrain cholinergic neurons, sparing the midpontine and striatal neurons which express no specific NGF receptors. It is feasible that the latter cholinergic neurons may be damaged by direct toxicity of tau, $\alpha$-synuclein and inflammations products through mechanisms not fully understood. Attention and learning and memory impairment are the functional consequences of the forebrain cholinergic neuron dysfunction, whereas the loss of midpontine cholinergic neurons results primarily in motor and sleep disturbances.},

abstract = {Human brains retain discrete populations of micro RNA (miRNA) species that support homeostatic brain gene expression functions; however, specific miRNA abundance is significantly altered in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD) when compared with age-matched controls. Here we provide evidence in AD brains of a specific up-regulation of an NF-kappaB-sensitive miRNA-146a highly complementary to the 3'-untranslated region of complement factor H (CFH), an important repressor of the inflammatory response of the brain. Up-regulation of miRNA-146a coupled to down-regulation of CFH was observed in AD brain and in interleukin-1beta, Abeta42, and/or oxidatively stressed human neural (HN) cells in primary culture. Transfection of HN cells using an NF-kappaB-containing pre-miRNA-146a promoter-luciferase reporter construct in stressed HN cells showed significant up-regulation of luciferase activity that paralleled decreases in CFH gene expression. Treatment of stressed HN cells with the NF-kappaB inhibitor pyrollidine dithiocarbamate or the resveratrol analog CAY10512 abrogated this response. Incubation of an antisense oligonucleotide to miRNA-146a (anti-miRNA-146a; AM-146a) was found to restore CFH expression levels. These data indicate that NF-kappaB-sensitive miRNA-146a-mediated modulation of CFH gene expression may in part regulate an inflammatory response in AD brain and in stressed HN cell models of AD and illustrate the potential for anti-miRNAs as an effective therapeutic strategy against pathogenic inflammatory signaling.},

abstract = {Stress insults intensify fear memory; however, the mechanism(s) facilitating this physiological response is still unclear. Here, we report the molecular, neurophysiological and behavioral findings attributing much of this effect to alternative splicing of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene in hippocampal neurons. As a case study, we explored immobilization-stressed mice with intensified fear memory and enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP), in which alternative splicing was found to induce overproduction of neuronal 'readthrough' AChE-R (AChE-R). Selective downregulation of AChE-R mRNA and protein by antisense oligonucleotides abolished the stress-associated increase in AChE-R, the elevation of contextual fear and LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region. Reciprocally, we intrahippocampally injected a synthetic peptide representing the C-terminal sequence unique to AChE-R. The injected peptide, which has been earlier found to exhibit no enzymatic activity, was incorporated into cortical, hippocampal and basal nuclei neurons by endocytosis and retrograde transport and enhanced contextual fear. Compatible with this hypothesis, inherited AChE-R overexpression in transgenic mice resulted in perikaryal clusters enriched with PKCbetaII, accompanied by PKC-augmented LTP enhancement. Our findings demonstrate a primary role for stress-induced alternative splicing of the AChE gene to elevated contextual fear and synaptic plasticity, and attribute to the AChE-R splice variant a major role in this process.},

Such annotations can have a critical role in identifying putatively causal variants for a disease or trait among the abundant natural variation that occurs at a locus of interest. The main challenges in using these various annotations include their large numbers and their diversity. Here we develop an unsupervised approach to integrate these different annotations into one measure of functional importance (Eigen) that, unlike most existing methods, is not based on any labeled training data. We show that the resulting meta-score has better discriminatory ability using disease-associated and putatively benign variants from published studies (in both coding and noncoding regions) than the recently proposed CADD score. Across varied scenarios, the Eigen score performs generally better than any single individual annotation, representing a powerful single functional score that can be incorporated in fine-mapping studies.},

abstract = {Mutations affecting the levels of microRNA miR-137 are associated with intellectual disability and schizophrenia. However, the pathophysiological role of miR-137 remains poorly understood. Here, we describe a highly conserved miR-137-binding site within the mRNA encoding the GluA1 subunit of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) and confirm that GluA1 is a direct target of miR-137. Postsynaptic downregulation of miR-137 at the CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapse selectively enhances AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission and converts silent synapses to active synapses. Conversely, miR-137 overexpression selectively reduces AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission and silences active synapses. In addition, we find that miR-137 is transiently upregulated in response to metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), but not mGluR1 activation. Consequently, acute interference with miR-137 function impedes mGluR-LTD expression. Our findings suggest that miR-137 is a key factor in the control of synaptic efficacy and mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity, supporting the notion that glutamatergic dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of miR-137-linked cognitive impairments. Olde Loohuis et al. reveal that microRNA miR-137, which is associated with intellectual disability and schizophrenia, controls AMPA-receptor-mediated transmission by targeting AMPA receptor subunit GluA1. miR-137 levels are regulated by mGluR5 activation, and, consequently, acute interference with miR-137 function impedes mGluR5-dependent synaptic plasticity.},

The neurotrophic hypothesis of psychiatric mood disorders postulates that in the adult brain, decreased BDNF levels leads to altered neural plasticity, contributing to disease. Although BDNF has been established as a key factor regulating the critical period plasticity in the developing visual system, it has recently been shown to also play a role in fear circuitry maturation, which has implications for the emergence of fear-related mood disorders. This review provides a detailed overview of developmental changes in expression of BDNF isoforms, as well as their receptors across postnatal life. In addition, recent developmental studies utilizing a genetic BDNF single nucleotide polymorphism (Val66Met) knock-in mouse highlight the impact of BDNF on fear learning during a sensitive period spanning the transition into adolescent time frame. We hypothesize that BDNF in the developing brain regulates fear circuit plasticity during a sensitive period in early adolescence, and alterations in BDNF expression (genetic or environmental) have a persistent impact on fear behavior and fear-related disorders.},

abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a most remarkable protein, not only because it is one of the fastest enzymes in nature, but also since it appears in many molecular forms and is regulated by elaborate genetic networks. AChE is expressed in many tissues during development and in mature organisms, as well as in healthy and diseased states. In search for alternative, "non-classical" functions of cholinesterases (ChEs), AChE could either work within the frame of classic cholinergic systems, but in non-neural tissues ("non-synaptic function"), or act non-enzymatically. Here, we review briefly some of the major ideas and advances of this field, and report on some recent progress from our own experimental work, e.g. that (i) non-neural ChEs have pronounced, predominantly enzymatic effects on early embryonic (limb) development in chick and mouse, that (ii) retinal R28 cells of the rat overexpressing synaptic AChE present a significantly decreased cell proliferation, and that (iii) in developing chick retina ACh-synthesizing and ACh-degrading cells originate from the same postmitotic precursor cells, which later form two locally opposing cell populations. We suggest that such distinct distributions of ChAT(+) vs. AChE(+) cells in the inner half retina provide graded distributions of ACh, which can direct cell differentiation and network formation. Thus, as corroborated by works from many labs, AChE can be considered a highly co-opting protein, which can combine enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions within one molecule.},

abstract = {Major programs in psychiatric genetics have identified {\textgreater}150 risk loci for psychiatric disorders. These loci converge on a small number of functional pathways, which span conventional diagnostic criteria, suggesting a partly common biology underlying schizophrenia, autism and other psychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the cellular phenotypes that capture the fundamental features of psychiatric disorders have not yet been determined. Recent advances in genetics and stem cell biology offer new prospects for cell-based modeling of psychiatric disorders. The advent of cell reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) provides an opportunity to translate genetic findings into patient-specific in vitro models. iPSC technology is less than a decade old but holds great promise for bridging the gaps between patients, genetics and biology. Despite many obvious advantages, iPSC studies still present multiple challenges. In this expert review, we critically review the challenges for modeling of psychiatric disorders, potential solutions and how iPSC technology can be used to develop an analytical framework for the evaluation and therapeutic manipulation of fundamental disease processes.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 31 May 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2016.89.},

MIR168a is abundant in rice and is one of the most highly enriched exogenous plant miRNAs in the sera of Chinese subjects. Functional studies in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that MIR168a could bind to the human/mouse low-density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein 1 (LDLRAP1) mRNA, inhibit LDLRAP1 expression in liver, and consequently decrease LDL removal from mouse plasma.

abstract = {Eosinophil localization to cholinergic nerves occurs in a variety of inflammatory conditions, including asthma. This localization is mediated by interactions between eosinophil integrins and neuronal vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Eosinophil-nerve cell interactions lead to generation of neuronal reactive oxygen species and release of eosinophil proteins. The effects of eosinophil adhesion on neuronal intracellular signaling pathways were investigated. Eosinophil adhesion to IMR32 cholinergic nerves led to a rapid and sustained activation of the nuclear transcription factors nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and activator protein (AP)-1 in the nerve cells. Eosinophil binding to neuronal ICAM-1 led to a rapid activation of ERK1/2 in nerve cells. Inhibition of ERK1/2 prevented NF-kappaB activation. Eosinophil adhesion to VCAM-1 resulted in AP-1 activation, mediated partially by rapid activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These data show that adhesion of eosinophils induces mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1 in nerve cells, indicating that eosinophil adhesion may control nerve growth and phenotype.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine is a major neurotransmitter that modulates cortical functions. In addition to basal forebrain neurons that give rise to the principal cholinergic input into the cortex, a second source constituted by intrinsic cholinergic interneurons has been identified. Although these cells have been characterized anatomically, little is known about their functional role in cortical microcircuits. The paucity of this cell population has been a major hindrance for detailed electrophysiological investigations. To facilitate functional studies, we generated transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons. Aided by the transgene expression, the characterization of distinct cholinergic interneurons was possible. These cells were located in layer 2-3, had a bipolar morphology, were calretinin- and vasoactive intestinal peptide positive, but had a non-GABAergic phenotype. Paired recordings showed that EGFP/ChAT-positive neurons receive excitatory and inhibitory input from adjacent principal cells and various types of interneurons. However, EGFP/ChAT-positive neurons do not exert direct postsynaptic responses in neighboring neurons. Interestingly, prolonged activation of EGFP-labeled cholinergic neurons induces an increase in spontaneous EPSCs in adjacent pyramidal neurons. This indirect effect is mediated by nicotinic receptors that are presumably presynaptically localized. Thus, intrinsic bipolar cholinergic neurons can modulate cortical function locally.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: While genome-wide association studies identified some promising candidates for schizophrenia, the majority of risk genes remained unknown. We were interested in testing whether integration gene expression and other functional information could facilitate the identification of susceptibility genes and related biological pathways. RESULTS: We conducted high throughput sequencing analyses to evaluate mRNA expression in blood samples isolated from 3 schizophrenia patients and 3 healthy controls. We also conducted pooled sequencing of 10 schizophrenic patients and matched controls. Differentially expressed genes were identified by t-test. In the individually sequenced dataset, we identified 198 genes differentially expressed between cases and controls, of them 19 had been verified by the pooled sequencing dataset and 21 reached nominal significance in gene-based association analyses of a genome wide association dataset. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes revealed that they were highly enriched in the immune related pathways. Two genes, S100A8 and TYROBP, had consistent changes in expression in both individual and pooled sequencing datasets and were nominally significant in gene-based association analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of gene expression and pathway analyses with genome-wide association may be an efficient approach to identify risk genes for schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disease, and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been linked to its pathogenesis. miR-603, a novel primate-specific miRNA and an intronic miRNA of a human brain highly expressed gene KIAA1217, is implicated in the risk and pathogenesis of AD. The rs11014002 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (C/U), which locates in miR-603 precursor (pre-miR-603), exhibits a protective effect towards AD risk. Additionally, the rs11014002 SNP promotes the biogenesis of mature miR-603. miR-603 downregulates LRPAP1 mRNA and protein levels through directly binding the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of LRPAP1. Moreover, miR-603 increases LRP1 protein expression. LRPAP1 and LRP1, playing opposite roles, are involved in A$\beta$ clearance and pathogenesis of AD. Strikingly, miR-603 exhibits a relatively higher expression and there is a loss of a negative correlation between miR-603 and LRPAP1/RND1 mRNA levels in the hippocampi of patients with AD. In addition, miR-603 directly downregulates a key neuronal apoptotic component-E2F1, and prevents HeLa cells from undergoing H2O2-induced apoptosis. This work suggests that miR-603 may be a novel AD-relevant miRNA and that its rs11014002 SNP may serve as a protective factor against AD.},

Studies on animal models of drug addiction indicate that persistent long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons is a critical component of sustained drug seeking. However, little is known about the mechanism regulating such long-lasting changes in synaptic strength. Previously, we identified that translational control by eIF2$\alpha$ phosphorylation (p-eIF2$\alpha$) regulates cocaine-induced LTP in the VTA (Huang et al., 2016). Here we report that in mice with reduced p-eIF2$\alpha$-mediated translation, cocaine induces persistent LTP in VTA DA neurons. Moreover, selectively inhibiting eIF2$\alpha$-mediated translational control with a small molecule ISRIB, or knocking down oligophrenin-1—an mRNA whose translation is controlled by p-eIF2$\alpha$—in the VTA also prolongs cocaine-induced LTP. This persistent LTP is mediated by the insertion of GluR2-lacking AMPARs. Collectively, our findings suggest that eIF2$\alpha$-mediated translational control regulates the progression from transient to persistent cocaine-induced LTP.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Apoptosis of cholinergic neurons is one of the core hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells differentiated to the cholinergic phenotype were exposed to 100nM staurosporine. Over a treatment period of 24h, the pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, caspase-3 and Bcl-2, as well as LDH release as a measure of cell viability, were assessed in conjunction with the number of apoptotic cells by means of fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Caspase-3 activity and LDH release increased by 30{\%} and 20{\%} over controls, respectively, while Bcl-2 levels rose by 200{\%} over controls. Furthermore, staurosporine treatment resulted in decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymatic activity and decreased protein levels of the AChE splice variant tailed AChE (AChE-T). Only a slight increase in levels of readthrough AChE (AChE-R) was observed. Likewise, staurosporine reduced levels and activity of the cholinergic players choline acetyltransferase and high affinity choline uptake. The present study demonstrates that treatment with staurosporine leads to apoptotic events, which, however, are not reflected in the increased AChE activity and the alterations of AChE isoforms expression that are usually seen in apoptotic conditions. The effects of various additional phosphorylation inhibitors on AChE activity suggest that these unexpected cholinergic effects, firstly, are linked to the impact of staurosporine on phosphorylation and, secondly, reveal themselves in a first phase of cellular adaption that precedes neurotoxicity and subsequent cell death.},

abstract = {Moderate, transient oxidative stress is achieved in SH-SY5Y cells using tertiary butylhydroperoxide as oxidant. Over a recovery period of 24 h, the enzymatic activity and protein levels of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) splice variants tailed AChE (AChE-T) and readthrough AChE (AChE-R) are monitored. Their time-dependent correlation to pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, namely caspase 3 and Bcl-2, respectively, as well as lactate dehydrogenase release as a measure of cell viability is assessed. A distinctly different expression pattern of AChE-T as compared with AChE-R is recorded, in that AChE-T shows only a very slight increase over a 6 h time period. In contrast, AChE-R rises continuously during the recovery period, reaching peak intracellular levels that are up to six times higher than control levels 3-4 h post-stress, and is released from cells in substantial amounts. Moreover, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 increases significantly, peaking 2-3 h after this AChE-R peak has occurred. We believe this study presents the first work that demonstrates - without relying on techniques of over-expression - the time-dependent correlation between apoptotic processes and related rescue mechanisms involving AChE isoforms in a neuronal cell line.},

abstract = {The cortical cholinergic input system has been described as a neuromodulator system that influences broadly defined behavioral and brain states. The discovery of phasic, trial-based increases in extracellular choline (transients), resulting from the hydrolysis of newly released acetylcholine (ACh), in the cortex of animals reporting the presence of cues suggests that ACh may have a more specialized role in cognitive processes. Here we expressed channelrhodopsin or halorhodopsin in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons of mice with optic fibers directed into this region and prefrontal cortex. Cholinergic transients, evoked in accordance with photostimulation parameters determined in vivo, were generated in mice performing a task necessitating the reporting of cue and noncue events. Generating cholinergic transients in conjunction with cues enhanced cue detection rates. Moreover, generating transients in noncued trials, where cholinergic transients normally are not observed, increased the number of invalid claims for cues. Enhancing hits and generating false alarms both scaled with stimulation intensity. Suppression of endogenous cholinergic activity during cued trials reduced hit rates. Cholinergic transients may be essential for synchronizing cortical neuronal output driven by salient cues and executing cue-guided responses.},

abstract = {Many bipolar disorder patients exhibit mixed affective states, which portend a generally more severe illness course and treatment resistance. In the previous renditions of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual mixed states were narrowly defined in the context of bipolar I disorder, but with the advent of DSM-5 the term "mixed episode" was dropped and replaced by "mixed features" specifier which could be broadly applied to manic, hypomanic and depressive episodes in both the bipolar spectrum and major depressive disorders. This paradigm shift reflected their significance in the prognosis and overall management of mood disorders, so that the clinicians should thoroughly familiarize themselves with the contemporary notions surrounding these conditions. The purpose of this manuscript is to bring to light the current conceptualizations regarding the etiology, pathogenesis and treatment of mixed states. To achieve this goal, in June 2016 an extensive literature search was undertaken using the PubMed database. Some exploratory terms utilized included "mixed states", "mixed episodes", "switching", "rapid cycling" cross referenced with "bipolar disorder". Focusing on the most relevant and up to date studies, it was revealed that mixed states result from genetic susceptibility in the circadian and dopamine neurotransmission apparatuses and disturbance in the intricate catecholamine-acetylcholine neurotransmission balance which leads to mood fluctuations. The management of mixed states is challenging with atypical antipsychotics, newer anticonvulsants and electroconvulsive therapy emerging as the foremost treatment options. In conclusion, while progress has been made in the neurobiological understanding of mixed states, the currently available therapeutic modalities have only shown limited effectiveness.},

abstract = {The use of an appropriate reference gene to ensure accurate normalisation is crucial for the correct quantification of gene expression using qPCR assays and RNA arrays. The main criterion for a gene to qualify as a reference gene is a stable expression across various cell types and experimental settings. Several reference genes are commonly in use but more and more evidence reveals variations in their expression due to the presence of on-going neuropathological disease processes, raising doubts concerning their use. We conducted an analysis of genome-wide changes of gene expression in the human central nervous system (CNS) covering several neurological disorders and regions, including the spinal cord, and were able to identify a number of novel stable reference genes. We tested the stability of expression of eight novel (ATP5E, AARS, GAPVD1, CSNK2B, XPNPEP1, OSBP, NAT5 and DCTN2) and four more commonly used (BECN1, GAPDH, QARS and TUBB) reference genes in a smaller cohort using RT-qPCR. The most stable genes out of the 12 reference genes were tested as normaliser to validate increased levels of a target gene in CNS disease. We found that in human post-mortem tissue the novel reference genes, XPNPEP1 and AARS, were efficient in replicating microarray target gene expression levels and that XPNPEP1 was more efficient as a normaliser than BECN1, which has been shown to change in expression as a consequence of neuronal cell loss. We provide herein one more suitable novel reference gene, XPNPEP1, with no current neuroinflammatory or neurodegenerative associations that can be used for gene quantitative gene expression studies with human CNS post-mortem tissue and also suggest a list of potential other candidates. These data also emphasise the importance of organ/tissue-specific stably expressed genes as reference genes for RNA studies.},

Associated genetic and gene expression changes have been identified, but many have not been replicated and have unknown functions. We identified groups of genes whose expressions varied together, that is co-expression modules, then tested them for association with SCZ. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we show that two modules were differentially expressed in patients versus controls. One, upregulated in cerebral cortex, was enriched with neuron differentiation and neuron development genes, as well as disease genome-wide association study genetic signals; the second, altered in cerebral cortex and cerebellum, was enriched with genes involved in neuron protection functions. The findings were preserved in five expression data sets, including sets from three brain regions, from a different microarray platform, and from BD patients. From those observations, we propose neuron differentiation and development pathways may be involved in etiologies of both SCZ and BD, and neuron protection function participates in pathological process of the diseases.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that function in complex networks to regulate protein expression. In the brain, they are involved in development and synaptic plasticity. In this study, we aimed to identify miRNAs with a differential expression in either hippocampus or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and age-matched nondemented control subjects using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In hippocampus, we also differentiated between AD patients with an intermediate stage, according to Braak III/IV stage, and a late stage, characterized according to Braak VI stage. Eight selected miRNAs were analyzed in hippocampus, and the expression of miR-16, miR-34c, miR-107, miR-128a, and miR-146a were differentially regulated. In CSF, out of 8 selected miRNAs only miR-16 and miR-146a could be reliably detected. In addition, we identified an effect of blood contamination on the CSF levels of miR-16, miR-24, and miR-146a. For group comparisons, we therefore selected CSF samples absent of, or containing only low numbers of blood cells. Levels of miR-146a were significantly decreased in CSF of AD patients. In conclusion, the abnormal expression of several miRNAs in hippocampus of intermediate- and late-stage AD patients suggests their involvement in AD pathogenesis, and low levels of miR-146a in CSF were associated with AD. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

In our opinion, NeurimmiRs that function within both the nervous and the immune systems, such as miR-132 and miR-124, may act as 'negotiators' between these two interacting compartments. We suggest that NeurimmiRs primarily target transcriptional or other regulatory genes, which enables modulation of both immune and cognitive processes through direct or indirect alterations of neuron-glia and/or brain-to-body signaling. Thus, manipulating NeurimmiR control over the immune contributions to cognitive pathways may offer new therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Specific immunocytochemical methods (AT8) permit evaluation of neuronal changes well before the actual formation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. Initial changes are found in the transentorhinal region (temporal lobe). From here the destructive process encroaches upon the entorhinal region, Ammon's horn, and neocortex. Initial changes occur in comparatively young individuals and can also be observed at the same predilection sites in a few species of old aged domestic animals. In a later state of destruction, AT8 immunoreactive neurons develop typical argyrophilic neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. Six stages of disease propagation can be distinguished with respect to the location of the tangle-bearing neurons and the severity of changes (transentorhinal stages I–II: clinically silent cases; limbic stages III–IV: incipient Alzheimer's disease; neocortical stages V–VI: fully developed Alzheimer's disease). Whole mount techniques reveal the lesional pattern of the particularly severely involved superficial entorhinal layer as seen from the free surface of the parahippocampal gyrus. This approach facilitates recognition of even subtle pathologic changes throughout the entire extent of cortical territories such as the transentorhinal and entorhinal regions.},

We define a manifold preservation metric, which we call denoised embedding manifold preservation (DEMaP), and show that PHATE produces lower-dimensional embeddings that are quantitatively better denoised as compared to existing visualization methods. An analysis of a newly generated single-cell RNA sequencing dataset on human germ-layer differentiation demonstrates how PHATE reveals unique biological insight into the main developmental branches, including identification of three previously undescribed subpopulations.

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently risen to prominence as novel factors responsible for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. miRNA genes have been posited as highly conserved in the clades in which they exist. Consequently, miRNAs have been used as rare genome change characters to estimate phylogeny by tracking their gain and loss. However, their short length (21–23 bp) has limited their perceived utility in sequenced-based phylo- genetic inference. Here, using reference taxa with established phylogenetic relationships, we demonstrate that miRNA sequences are of high utility in quantitative, rather than in qualitative, phylogenetic analysis. The clear orthol- ogy among miRNA genes from different species makes it straightforward to identify and align these sequences from even fragmentary datasets. We also identify significant sequence conservation in the regions directly flanking miRNA genes, and show that this too is of utility in phylogenetic analysis, as well as highlighting conserved regions that will be of interest to other fields. Employing miRNA sequences from 12 sequenced drosophilid genomes, together with a Tribolium castaneum outgroup, we demonstrate that this approach is robust using Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods. The utility of these characters is further demonstrated in the rhabditid nematodes and primates. As next-generation sequencing makes it more cost-effective to sequence genomes and small RNA libraries, this methodology provides an alternative data source for phylogenetic analysis. The approach allows rapid resolution of relationships between both closely related and rapidly evolving species, and provides an additional tool for investigation of relationships within the tree of life.},

abstract = {Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y is a dopaminergic neuronal cell line which has been used as an in vitro model for neurotoxicity experiments. Although the neuroblastoma is usually differentiated by all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), both RA-differentiated and undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells have been used in neuroscience research. However, the changes in neuronal properties triggered by RA as well as the subsequent responsiveness to neurotoxins have not been comprehensively studied. Therefore, we aim to re-evaluate the differentiation property of RA on this cell line. We hypothesize that modulation of signaling pathways and neuronal properties during RA-mediated differentiation in SH-SY5Y cells can affect their susceptibility to neurotoxins. The differentiation property of RA was confirmed by showing an extensive outgrowth of neurites, increased expressions of neuronal nuclei, neuron specific enolase, synaptophysin and synaptic associated protein-97, and decreased expression of inhibitor of differentiation-1. While undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells were susceptible to 6-OHDA and MPP+, RA-differentiation conferred SH-SY5Y cells higher tolerance, potentially by up-regulating survival signaling, including Akt pathway as inhibition of Akt removed RA-induced neuroprotection against 6-OHDA. As a result, the real toxicity cannot be revealed in RA-differentiated cells. Therefore, undifferentiated SH-SY5Y is more appropriate for studying neurotoxicity or neuroprotection in experimental Parkinson's disease research.},

abstract = {Sirt1, a mammalian member of the sirtuin gene family, holds great potential for promoting longevity, preventing against disease and increasing cell survival. For example, studies suggest that the beneficial impact of caloric restriction in promoting longevity and cellular function may be mediated, in part, by Sirt1 through mechanisms involving PGC-1??, which plays important role in the regulation of cellular metabolism and inflammatory and antioxidant responses. Sirt1 may also interfere with mechanisms implicated in pathological disorders. We will present recent evidence indicating that Sirt1 may protect against Alzheimer's disease by interfering with the generation of ??-amyloid peptides. We will discuss Sirt1 as a potential novel target, in addition to the development of Sirt1 activators for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Inhibition of protein translation plays an important role in apoptosis. While double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is named as it is activated by double-stranded RNA produced by virus, its activation induces an inhibition of protein translation and apoptosis via the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha). PKR is also a stress kinase and its levels increase during ageing. Here we show that PKR activation and eIF2alpha phosphorylation play a significant role in apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells and primary neuronal cultures induced by the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, the calcium ionophore A23187 and flavonoids. The phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and the number of apoptotic cells were enhanced in over-expressed wild-type PKR neuroblastoma cells exposed to Abeta peptide, while dominant-negative PKR reduced eIF2alpha phosphorylation and apoptosis induced by Abeta peptide. Primary cultured neurons from PKR knockout mice were also less sensitive to Abeta peptide toxicity. Activation of PKR and eIF2alpha pathway by Abeta peptide are triggered by an increase in intracellular calcium because the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM significantly reduced PKR phosphorylation. Taken together, these results reveal that PKR and eIF2alpha phosphorylation could be involved in the molecular signalling events leading to neuronal apoptosis and death and could be a new target in neuroprotection.},

abstract = {The sequence diversity of individual human genomes has been extensively analyzed for variations and phenotypic implications for mRNA, miRNA, and long non-coding RNA genes. TRNA (tRNA) also exhibits large sequence diversity in the human genome, but tRNA gene sequence variation and potential functional implications in individual human genomes have not been investigated. Here we capitalize on the sequencing data from the 1000-genomes project to examine the diversity of tRNA genes in the human population. Previous analysis of the reference human genome indicated an unexpected large number of diverse tRNA genes beyond the necessity of translation, suggesting that some tRNA transcripts may perform non-canonical functions. We found 24 new tRNA sequences in{\textgreater}1{\%} and 76 new tRNA sequences in{\textgreater}0.2{\%} of all individuals, indicating that tRNA genes are also subject to evolutionary changes in the human population. Unexpectedly, two abundant new tRNA genes contain base-pair mismatches in the anticodon stem. We experimentally determined that these two new tRNAs have altered structures in vitro; however, one new tRNA is not aminoacylated but extremely stable in HeLa cells, suggesting that this new tRNA can be used for non-canonical function. Our results show that at the scale of human population, tRNA genes are more diverse than conventionally understood, and some new tRNAs may perform non-canonical, extra-translational functions that may be linked to human health and disease.},

abstract = {Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS) is a motor neuron degenerative disease of unknown etiology. Current thinking on SALS is that multiple genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease liability. Since neuronal acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are part of the glutamatergic pathway, we searched for sequence variants in CHRNA3, CHRNA4 and CHRNB4 genes, encoding neuronal nicotinic AChR subunits, in 245 SALS patients and in 450 controls. We characterized missense variants by in vitro mutagenesis, cell transfection and electrophysiology. Sequencing the regions encoding the intracellular loop of AChRs subunits disclosed 15 missense variants (6.1{\%}) in 14 patients compared with only six variants (1.3{\%}) in controls (P = 0.001; OR 4.48, 95{\%} CI 1.7-11.8). The frequency of variants in exons encoding extracellular and transmembrane domains and in intronic regions did not differ. NAChRs formed by mutant alpha3 and alpha4 and wild-type (WT) beta4 subunits exhibited altered affinity for nicotine (Nic), reduced use-dependent rundown of Nic-activated currents (I(Nic)) and reduced desensitization leading to sustained intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, in comparison with WT-nAChR. The cellular loop has a crucial importance for receptor trafficking and regulating ion channel properties. Missense variants in this domain are significantly over-represented in SALS patients and alter functional properties of nAChR in vitro, resulting in increased Ca(2+) entry into the cells. We suggest that these gain-of-function variants might contribute to disease liability in a subset of SALS because Ca(2+) signals mediate nAChR's neuromodulatory effects, including regulation of glutamate release and control of cell survival.},
annote = {The accumulation of rare, mildly deleterious mutations in
an individual human genome is likely to be an important con- tributor to complex diseases, including SALS (24–26). These mutations are weakly evolutionarily deleterious and their low frequency in the human population is the result of mutation- selection balance. The low allele frequency of an amino acid variant can, by itself, serve as predictor of its functional
significance, with lower frequency indicating greater patho- genicity (24). According to the mutation-selection model, the weak purifying selection against susceptibility alleles is likely to result in extensive allelic heterogeneity, with low fre- quency mutations at many different sites (26). Thus the cumu- lative frequency of rare mutations rather than their individual frequencies is considered a suitable method for candidate gene investigations (24).},

abstract = {Three principal features of mammalian stress responses are that they span peripheral and CNS changes, modify blood cell composition and activities, and cover inter-related alterations in a large number of gene products. The finely tuned spatiotemporal regulation of these multiple events suggests the hierarchic involvement of modulatory neurotransmitters and modified process(es) in the pathway of gene expression that together would enable widely diverse stress responses. We report evidence supporting the notion that acetylcholine (ACh) acts as a stress-response-regulating transmitter and that altered ACh levels are variously associated with changes in the alternative splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts in brain neurons and peripheral blood cells. We used acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene expression as a case study and developed distinct probes for its alternative splice variants at the mRNA and protein levels. In laboratory animals and human-derived cells, we found stress-induced changes in the alternative splicing patterns of AChE pre-mRNA, which attributes to this gene and its different protein products diverse stress responsive functions that are associated with the enzymatic and noncatalytic properties of AChE. Together, these approaches provide a conceptually unified view of the studied pathways for controlling stress responses in brain and blood.},

We report that a host microRNA, miR-30c, was upregulated by PRRSV via activating NF-kappaB and facilitated its ability to infect subject animals. Subsequently, we demonstrated that miR-30c was a potent negative regulator of IFN-I signaling by targeting JAK1, resulting in the enhancement of PRRSV infection. In addition, we found that JAK1 expression was significantly decreased by PRRSV and recovered when miR-30c inhibitor was overexpressed. Importantly, miR-30c was also upregulated by PRRSV infection in vivo, and miR-30c expression corresponded well with viral loads in lungs and porcine alveolar macrophages of PRRSV-infected pigs. Our findings identify a new strategy taken by PRRSV to escape IFN-I-mediated antiviral immune responses by engaging miR-30c and, thus, improve our understanding of its pathogenesis.},

BDNF also regulates plasticity-related processes underlying memory and learning.

The SNP rs6265 is a single base mutation with an adenine instead of a guanine at position 196 (G196A), resulting in the amino acid substitution Val66Met. This polymorphism only exists in humans and has been associated with a plethora of effects ranging from molecular, cellular and brain structural modifications in association with deficits in social and cognitive functions. To date, the literature on Val66Met polymorphism describes a complex and often conflicting pattern of effects. In this review, we attempt to provide a unifying model of the Val66Met effects. We discuss the clinical evidence of the association between Val66Met and memory deficits, as well as the molecular mechanisms involved including the reduced transport of BDNF mRNA to the dendrites as well as the reduced processing and secretion of BDNF protein through the regulated secretory pathway.},

In addition, 5-azacytidine, bromodeoxyuridine, leukemia inhibitory factor, and N-2 substantially increased [3H]acetylcholine levels, and these increases correlated highly with increases in total acetylcholine levels.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE A high incidence of thromboembolic events has been reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Phosphatidylserine (PS) is normally sequestered in the inner leaflet of cell membranes. Externalization of PS during cell activation is mediated by phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) and has a central role in promoting blood coagulation. We investigated the underlying pathogenic status of thrombophilia in SLE by analyzing PLSCR1 expression on monocytes from patients with SLE. METHODS Sixty patients with SLE were evaluated. Twenty-three patients had antiphospholipid syndrome (APS/SLE). Plasma D-dimer levels were measured as a marker of fibrin turnover. The cDNA encoding human PLSCR1 was cloned from the total RNA extract from monocytes, and independent clones were sequenced. PLSCR1 mRNA expression in CD14+ cells was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. PS exposure on CD14+ cell surface was analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS Elevated D-dimer levels were found in plasma from SLE patients. Three splice variants of PLSCR1 mRNA were identified in all subjects, and levels of full-length PLSCR1 mRNA were significantly increased in SLE compared to healthy controls (2.9 +/- 1.5 vs 1.3 +/- 0.4, respectively; p {\textless} 0.0001). Flow-cytometry analysis showed relative enhancement of PS exposure in the surface of CD14+ cells in SLE patients compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSION Novel PLSCR1 splice variants were identified. Monocytes in SLE patients had enhanced PLSCR1 mRNA expression, as well as increased fibrin turnover and cell-surface PS exposure, indicating that PLSCR1 may, in part, contribute to the prothrombotic tendency in SLE.},

abstract = {Sympathetic neurons are generated through a succession of differentiation steps that initially lead to noradrenergic neurons innervating different peripheral target tissues. Specific targets, like sweat glands in rodent footpads, induce a change from noradrenergic to cholinergic transmitter phenotype. Here, we show that cytokines acting through the gp 130 receptor are present in sweat glands. Selective elimination of the gp 130 receptor in sympathetic neurons prevents the acquisition of cholinergic and peptidergic features (VAChT, ChT1, VIP) without affecting other properties of sweat gland innervation. The vast majority of cholinergic neurons in the stellate ganglion, generated postnatally, are absent in gp 130-deficient mice. These results demonstrate an essential role of gp 130-signaling in the target-dependent specification of the cholinergic neurotransmitter phenotype.},

abstract = {We present a human miRNA tissue atlas by determining the abundance of 1997 miRNAs in 61 tissue biopsies of different organs from two individuals collected post-mortem. One thousand three hundred sixty-four miRNAs were discovered in at least one tissue, 143 were present in each tissue. To define the distribution of miRNAs, we utilized a tissue specificity index (TSI). The majority of miRNAs (82.9{\%}) fell in a middle TSI range i.e. were neither specific for single tissues (TSI {\textgreater} 0.85) nor housekeeping miRNAs (TSI {\textless} 0.5). Nonetheless, we observed many different miRNAs and miRNA families that were predominantly expressed in certain tissues. Clustering of miRNA abundances revealed that tissues like several areas of the brain clustered together. Considering -3p and -5p mature forms we observed miR-150 with different tissue specificity. Analysis of additional lung and prostate biopsies indicated that inter-organism variability was significantly lower than inter-organ variability. Tissue-specific differences between the miRNA patterns appeared not to be significantly altered by storage as shown for heart and lung tissue. MiRNAs TSI values of human tissues were significantly (P = 10−8) correlated with those of rats; miRNAs that were highly abundant in certain human tissues were likewise abundant in according rat tissues.

abstract = {Huntington's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the striatum, above all, the GABAergic striatal projection neurons. In the present study, we have explored the use of genetically modified neural stem cell lines producing nerve growth factor (NGF) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as a means to protect the striatal neurons against excitotoxic damage after transplantation to the striatum, 1 week before the injection of quinolinic acid into the same area. One month after the lesion, striatal degeneration, lesion size, and loss of DARPP-32-positive projection neurons were only slightly affected by the BDNF-secreting cells, but substantially prevented when NGF-producing stem cells were used as a source of exogenous trophic factor; innervation of the target fields (pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus) was preserved as well. Cholinergic striatal interneurons (choline acetyltransferase- immunoreactive) were affected by the lesion and completely rescued by the NGF-transduced cells. The astroglial and microglial reactions to the excitotoxic lesion were substantially reduced in the striata, which had received transplants of NGF-producing cells. The generalized protective effects of the NGF-producing cell grafts in this model are discussed in the context of an indirect action preventing the development of toxicity mediated by cellular elements in the host striatum in response to the excitotoxin. We conclude that continuous supply of trophic factors by means of genetically modified neural stem cells represents a highly effective procedure to counteract neuronal degeneration in the excitotoxically lesioned striatum.},

abstract = {The sole FDA-approved drug treatment for ischemic stroke is tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). However, upregulation of JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and endothelin 1 (ET-1) by tPA after stroke contributes to impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation. Wild-type (wt) tPA can bind to the lipoprotein-related receptor (LRP), which mediates vasodilation, or NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs), exacerbating vasoconstriction. Elevations in IL-6, a marker of inflammation that accompanies stroke, are reported to be an adverse prognostic factor. We hypothesized that IL-6 released into CSF after stroke by wt-tPA through activation of NMDA-Rs and upregulation of ET-1 and JNK contribute to impairment of cerebrovascular autoregulation and increased histopathology. Results show that IL-6 was increased post stroke in pigs, which was increased further by wt-tPA. Co-administration of the IL-6 antagonist LMT-28 with wt-tPA prevented impairment of cerebrovascular autoregulation and necrosis of hippocampal cells. wt-tPA co-administered with the JNK inhibitor SP 600125 and the ET-1 antagonist BQ 123 blocked stroke-induced elevation of IL-6. Co-administration of LMT-28 with wt-tPA blocked the augmentation of JNK and ET-1 post stroke. In conclusion, IL-6 released after stroke, which is enhanced by wt-tPA through activation of NMDA-Rs and upregulation of ET-1 and JNK, impairs cerebrovascular autoregulation and increases histopathology. Strategies that promote fibrinolysis while limiting activation of NMDA-Rs and upregulation of IL-6 may improve the benefit/risk ratio compared to wt-tPA in treatment of stroke.},

abstract = {The development and exacerbation of depression and anxiety are associated with exposure to repeated psychosocial stress. Stress is known to affect the bidirectional communication between the nervous and immune systems leading to elevated levels of stress mediators including glucocorticoids (GCs) and catecholamines and increased trafficking of proinflammatory immune cells. Animal models, like the repeated social defeat (RSD) paradigm, were developed to explore this connection between stress and affective disorders. RSD induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation, increases bone marrow production and egress of primed, GC-insensitive monocytes, and stimulates the trafficking of these cells to tissues including the spleen, lung, and brain. Recently, the observation that these monocytes have the ability to traffic to the brain perivascular spaces and parenchyma have provided mechanisms by which these peripheral cells may contribute to the prolonged anxiety-like behavior associated with RSD. The data that have been amassed from the RSD paradigm and others recapitulate many of the behavioral and immunological phenotypes associated with human anxiety disorders and may serve to elucidate potential avenues of treatment for these disorders. Here, we will discuss novel and key data that will present an overview of the neuroendocrine, immunological and behavioral responses to social stressors.},

abstract = {We examined the molecular and functional characterization of choline uptake into human neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y: non-cholinergic and LA-N-2: cholinergic neuroblastoma), and the association between choline transport and acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis in these cells. Choline uptake was saturable and mediated by a single transport system. Removal of Na+ from the uptake buffer strongly enhanced choline uptake. Choline uptake was inhibited by the choline analogue hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) and various organic cations, and was significantly decreased by acidification of the extracellular medium. The increase in choline uptake under Na+-free conditions was inhibited by a Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) inhibitor. Real-time PCR revealed that choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL1), NHE1 and NHE5 mRNA are mainly expressed. Western blot and immunocytochemical analysis indicated that CTL1 protein was expressed in plasma membrane. ChAT mRNA was expressed at a much higher level in LA-N-2 cells than in SH-SY5Y cells. The conversion of choline to ACh was confirmed in both cells, and was enhanced in Na+-free conditions. These findings suggest that CTL1 is functionally expressed in both SH-SY5Y and LA-N-2 cells and is responsible for choline uptake that relies on a directed H+ gradient as a driving force, and this transport functions in co-operation with NHE1 and NHE5. Furthermore, choline uptake through CTL1 is associated with ACh synthesis in cholinergic neuroblastoma cells. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine in vivo cortical acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and cognitive effects in subjects with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 14) prior to and after 12 weeks of donepezil therapy.

METHODS: Cognitive and N-[(11)C]methyl-piperidin-4-yl propionate ([(11)C]PMP) AChE positron emission tomography (PET) assessments before and after donepezil therapy.

RESULTS: Analysis of the PET data revealed mean (temporal, parietal, and frontal) cortical donepezil induced AChE inhibition of 19.1{\%} (SD 9.4{\%}) (t = -7.9; p{\textless}0.0001). Enzyme inhibition was most robust in the anterior cingulate cortex (24.2{\%} (6.9{\%}), t = -14.1; p{\textless}0.0001). Donepezil induced cortical inhibition of AChE activity correlated with changes in the Stroop Color Word interference scores (R(2) = 0.59, p{\textless}0.01), but not with primary memory test scores. Analysis of the Stroop test data indicated that subjects with AChE inhibition greater than the median value ({\textgreater}22.2{\%}) had improved scores on the Stroop Color Word Test compared with subjects with less inhibition who had stable to worsening scores (t = -2.7; p{\textless}0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: Donepezil induced inhibition of cortical AChE enzyme activity is modest in patients with mild AD. The degree of cortical enzyme inhibition correlates with changes in executive and attentional functions.},

abstract = {Cholinergic synapses are ubiquitous in the human central nervous system. Their high density in the thalamus, striatum, limbic system, and neocortex suggest that cholinergic transmission is likely to be critically important for memory, learning, attention and other higher brain functions. Several lines of research suggest additional roles for cholinergic systems in overall brain homeostasis and plasticity. As such, the brain's cholinergic system occupies a central role in ongoing research related to normal cognition and age-related cognitive decline, including dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease centres on the progressive loss of limbic and neocortical cholinergic innervation. Neurofibrillary degeneration in the basal forebrain is believed to be the primary cause for the dysfunction and death of forebrain cholinergic neurons, giving rise to a widespread presynaptic cholinergic denervation. Cholinesterase inhibitors increase the availability of acetylcholine at synapses in the brain and are one of the few drug therapies that have been proven clinically useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease dementia, thus validating the cholinergic system as an important therapeutic target in the disease. This review includes an overview of the role of the cholinergic system in cognition and an updated understanding of how cholinergic deficits in Alzheimer's disease interact with other aspects of disease pathophysiology, including plaques composed of amyloid-$\beta$ proteins. This review also documents the benefits of cholinergic therapies at various stages of Alzheimer's disease and during long-term follow-up as visualized in novel imaging studies. The weight of the evidence supports the continued value of cholinergic drugs as a standard, cornerstone pharmacological approach in Alzheimer's disease, particularly as we look ahead to future combination therapies that address symptoms as well as disease progression.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a progressive loss of memory and deterioration of higher cognitive functions. The brain of an individual with Alzheimer's disease exhibits extracellular plaques of aggregated beta-amyloid protein (Abeta), intracellular neurofibrillary tangles that contain hyperphosphorylated tau protein and a profound loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that innervate the hippocampus and the neocortex. Abeta accumulation may trigger or contribute to the process of neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms whereby Abeta induces basal forebrain cholinergic cell loss and cognitive impairment remain obscure. Physiologically relevant concentrations of Abeta-related peptides have acute, negative effects on multiple aspects of acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis and release, without inducing toxicity. These data suggest a neuromodulatory influence of the peptides on central cholinergic functions. Long-term exposure to micromolar Abeta induces cholinergic cell toxicity, possibly via hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Conversely, activation of selected cholinergic receptors has been shown to alter the processing of the amyloid precursor protein as well as phosphorylation of tau protein. A direct interaction between Abeta and nicotinic ACh receptors has also been demonstrated. This review addresses the role of Abeta-related peptides in regulating the function and survival of central cholinergic neurons and the relevance of these effects to cholinergic deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the functional interrelations between Abeta peptides, cholinergic neurons and tau phosphorylation will unravel the biologic events that precede neurodegeneration and may lead to the development of more effective pharmacotherapies for Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Identification of important nodes in complex networks has attracted an increasing attention over the last decade. Various measures have been proposed to characterize the importance of nodes in complex networks, such as the degree, betweenness and PageRank. Different measures consider different aspects of complex networks. Although there are numerous results reported on undirected complex networks, few results have been reported on directed biological networks. Based on network motifs and principal component analysis (PCA), this paper aims at introducing a new measure to characterize node importance in directed biological networks. Investigations on five real-world biological networks indicate that the proposed method can robustly identify actually important nodes in different networks, such as finding command interneurons, global regulators and non-hub but evolutionary conserved actually important nodes in biological networks. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for the five networks indicate remarkable prediction accuracy of the proposed measure. The proposed index provides an alternative complex network metric. Potential implications of the related investigations include identifying network control and regulation targets, biological networks modeling and analysis, as well as networked medicine.},

abstract = {Protein translation is regulated during both initiation and elongation phases to enable cells to accommodate for ever-changing environmental and internal states. Eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2)$\alpha$, a major signaling pathway for responses to metabolic stress, controls translation initiation in various cells, including neurons, and affects cognitive functions. The main risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD) is aging, and the main genetic risk factor reducing the age of SAD onset is the expression of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)4. We tested the hypothesis that both genetic and aging risk factors converge on the eIF2$\alpha$ pathway. Aged rodents showed increased eIF2$\alpha$ phosphorylation in the brain, indicating a shift in the rate of translation initiation with increasing age. Interestingly, mice overexpressing human ApoE4 already, at an early age, exhibited increased eIF2$\alpha$ phosphorylation together with mild impairment in cognitive tasks, compared with ApoE3 mice. These results suggest that the eIF2$\alpha$ pathway is linked to SAD, possibly via genetic as well as prolonged metabolic stress, and these findings position it as a new and important target for treatment of the currently incurable Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Abnormal regulation of tau phosphorylation and/or alternative splicing is associated with the development of a large ({\textgreater}20) group of neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as tauopathies, the most common being Alzheimer's disease. Despite intensive research, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that participate in the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of endogenous tau, especially in neurons. Recently, we showed that mice lacking Dicer in the forebrain displayed progressive neurodegeneration accompanied by disease-like changes in tau phosphorylation and splicing. Dicer is a key enzyme in the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNAs that function as part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to repress gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. We identified miR-16 and miR-132 as putative endogenous modulators of neuronal tau phosphorylation and tau exon 10 splicing, respectively. Interestingly, these miRNAs have been implicated in cell survival and function, whereas changes in miR-16/132 levels correlate with tau pathology in human neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, understanding how miRNA networks influence tau metabolism and possibly other biological systems might provide important clues into the molecular causes of tauopathies, particularly the more common but less understood sporadic forms.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Both non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the multitarget complexity of microRNA (miR) suppression have recently raised much interest, but the in vivo impact and context-dependence of hepatic miR-target interactions are incompletely understood. Assessing the relative in vivo contributions of specific targets to miR-mediated phenotypes is pivotal for investigating metabolic processes. DESIGN We quantified fatty liver parameters and the levels of miR-132 and its targets in novel transgenic mice overexpressing miR-132, in liver tissues from patients with NAFLD, and in diverse mouse models of hepatic steatosis. We tested the causal nature of miR-132 excess in these phenotypes by injecting diet-induced obese mice with antisense oligonucleotide suppressors of miR-132 or its target genes, and measured changes in metabolic parameters and transcripts. RESULTS Transgenic mice overexpressing miR-132 showed a severe fatty liver phenotype and increased body weight, serum low-density lipoprotein/very low-density lipoprotein (LDL/VLDL) and liver triglycerides, accompanied by decreases in validated miR-132 targets and increases in lipogenesis and lipid accumulation-related transcripts. Likewise, liver samples from both patients with NAFLD and mouse models of hepatic steatosis or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) displayed dramatic increases in miR-132 and varying decreases in miR-132 targets compared with controls. Furthermore, injecting diet-induced obese mice with anti-miR-132 oligonucleotides, but not suppressing its individual targets, reversed the hepatic miR-132 excess and hyperlipidemic phenotype. CONCLUSIONS Our findings identify miR-132 as a key regulator of hepatic lipid homeostasis, functioning in a context-dependent fashion via suppression of multiple targets and with cumulative synergistic effects. This indicates reduction of miR-132 levels as a possible treatment of hepatic steatosis.},

abstract = {Previously, the contribution of peripheral infection to cognitive decline was largely overlooked however, the past 15 years have established a key role for infectious pathogens in the progression of age-related neurodegeneration. It is now accepted that the immune privilege of the brain is not absolute, and that cells of the central nervous system are sensitive to both the inflammatory events occurring in the periphery and to the infiltration of peripheral immune cells. This is particularly relevant for the progression of Alzheimer's disease, in which it has been demonstrated that patients are more vulnerable to infection-related cognitive changes. This can occur from typical infectious challenges such as respiratory tract infections, although a number of specific viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens have also been associated with the development of the disease. To date, it is not clear whether these microorganisms are directly related to Alzheimer's disease progression or if they are opportune pathogens that easily colonize those with dementia and exacerbate the ongoing inflammation observed in these individuals. This review will discuss the impact of each of these challenges, and examine the changes known to occur with age in the peripheral immune system, which may contribute to the age-related vulnerability to infection-induced cognitive decline.},

The need for cumbersome RNA purification is circumvented in our assays by making use of a commercial reagent that can easily generate crude cell lysates amenable to direct analysis by one-step RT-qPCR. In the present study, we demonstrate that a simple buffer containing a non-ionic detergent can serve as an inexpensive alternative to commercially available reagents for the purpose of generating RT-qPCR-ready cell lysates from MDCK cells infected with influenza virus.

abstract = {Within the autonomic system, acetylcholine signaling contributes simultaneously and interactively to cognitive, behavioral, muscle and immune functions. Therefore, manipulating cholinergic parameters such as the activities of the acetylcholine hydrolyzing enzymes in body fluids or the corresponding transcript levels in blood leukocytes can change the global status of the autonomic system in treated individuals. Specifically, cholinesterase activities are subject to rapid and effective changes. The enzyme activity baseline increases with age and body mass index and depends on gender and ethnic origin. Also, the corresponding DNA (for detecting mutations) and RNA (for measuring specific mRNA transcripts) of cholinergic genes present individual variability. In leukocytes, acetylcholine inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting relevance of cholinergic parameters to both the basal levels and to disease-induced inflammation. Inversely, acetylcholine levels increase under various stress stimuli, inducing changes in autonomic system molecules (e.g., pro-inflammatory cytokines) which can penetrate the brain; therefore, manipulating these levels can also effect brain reactions, mainly of anxiety, depression and pain. Additionally, neurodegenerative diseases often involve exacerbated inflammation, depression and anxiety, providing a focus interest group for cholinergic manipulations. In Alzheimer's disease, the systemic cholinergic impairments reflect premature death of cholinergic neurons. The decline of cholinesterases in the serum of Parkinson's disease and post- stroke patients, discovery of the relevant microRNAs and the growing range of use of anticholinesterase medications all call for critical re-inspection of established and novel approaches for manipulating cholinergic parameters.},

abstract = {Sleep and wake states are regulated by a variety of mechanisms. One such important system is the circadian clock, which provides temporal structure to sleep and wake. Conversely, changes in behavioral state, such as sleep deprivation (SD) or arousal, can phase shift the circadian clock. Here we demonstrate that the level of wakefulness is critical for this arousal resetting of the circadian clock. Specifically, drowsy animals with significant power in the 7- to 9-Hz band of their EEGs do not exhibit phase shifts in response to a mild SD procedure. We then show that treatments that both produce arousal and reset the phase of circadian clock activate (i.e., induce Fos expression in) the basal forebrain. Many of the activated cells are cholinergic. Using retrograde tract tracing, we demonstrate that cholinergic cells activated by these arousal procedures project to the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). We then demonstrate that arousal-induced phase shifts are blocked when animals are pretreated with atropine injections to the SCN, demonstrating that cholinergic activity at the SCN is necessary for arousal-induced phase shifting. Finally, we demonstrate that electrical stimulation of the substantia innominata of the basal forebrain phase shifts the circadian clock in a manner similar to that of our arousal procedures and that these shifts are also blocked by infusions of atropine to the SCN. These results establish a functional link between the major forebrain arousal center and the circadian system.},

We performed a selective overview of the current literature on miRNAs putative subcellular localization and sites of action in mature neurons analyzing their role in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, pathological stress changes, major affective disorders and suicidal behavior. miRNAs have played a fundamental role in the evolution of brain functions. The perturbation of some intracellular mechanisms as well as impaired assembly, localization, and translational regulation of specific RNA binding proteins may affect learning and memory, presumably contributing to the pathogenesis of major affective disorders and perhaps suicidal behavior. Also, miRNA dys-regulation has also been linked to several neuropsychiatric diseases. However, further evidence are needed in order to directly clarify the role of miRNAs in major affective disorders and suicidal behavior.},

Here, we apply an unbiased sequencing-based systems approach to characterize miR-522, a member of the oncogenic primate-specific chromosome 19 miRNA cluster, highly expressed in poorly differentiated cancers. To identify miRNA targets, we sequenced full-length transcripts captured by a biotinylated miRNA mimic. Within these targets, mostly noncanonical MREs were identified by sequencing RNase-resistant fragments. miR-522 overexpression reduced mRNA, protein levels, and luciferase activity of {\textgreater}70{\%} of a random list of candidate target genes and MREs. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that miR-522 regulates cell proliferation, detachment, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. miR-522 induces G1 cell-cycle arrest and causes cells to detach without anoikis, become invasive, and express mesenchymal genes. Thus, our method provides a simple but effective technique for identifying miRNA-regulated genes and biological function. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Bipolar affective disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component but unknown pathophysiology. We used microarray technology to determine the expression of approximately 22,000 mRNA transcripts in post-mortem tissue from two brain regions in patients with bipolar disorder and matched healthy controls. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue from a cohort of 70 subjects and orbitofrontal cortex tissue from a separate cohort of 30 subjects was investigated. The final analysis included 30 bipolar and 31 control subjects for the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 10 bipolar and 11 control subjects for the orbitofrontal cortex. Differences between disease and control groups were identified using a rigorous statistical analysis with correction for confounding variables and multiple testing. In the orbitofrontal cortex, 393 differentially expressed transcripts were identified by microarray analysis and a representative subset was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Pathway analysis revealed significant upregulation of genes involved in G-protein coupled receptor signalling and response to stimulus (in particular the immune response), while genes relating to the ubiquitin cycle and intracellular transport showed coordinated downregulation in bipolar disorder. Additionally, several genes involved in synaptic function were significantly downregulated in bipolar disorder. No significant changes in gene expression were observed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using microarray analysis or quantitative real-time PCR. Our findings implicate the orbitofrontal cortex as a region prominently involved in bipolar disorder and indicate that diverse processes are affected. Overall, our results suggest that dysregulation of the ubiquitin pathway and synaptic function may be central to the disease process.},

Neuronal AChE variants show indistinguishable enzymatic activity yet differ in their expression, multimeric assembly and membrane-association patterns. Differentially induced under stress, they show distinct non-hydrolytic properties and interact with different protein partners. Recent findings suggest that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of AChE pre-mRNA is a neuroprotection strategy but might involve long-term damage. Specifically, variant-specific causal involvement of AChE in the progression of both neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases) and neuromuscular syndromes (e.g. myasthenia gravis) raises the possibility that future therapeutic drugs might target specific AChE variant(s) or the corresponding RNA transcripts.},

abstract = {Psychiatric disorders are multigenic diseases with complex etiology that contribute significantly to human morbidity and mortality. Although clinically distinct, several disorders share many symptoms, suggesting common underlying molecular changes exist that may implicate important regulators of pathogenesis and provide new therapeutic targets. We performed RNA sequencing on tissue from the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens from three groups of 24 patients each diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder, and from 24 control subjects. We identified differentially expressed genes and validated the results in an independent cohort. Anterior cingulate cortex samples were also subjected to metabolomic analysis. ChIP-seq data were used to characterize binding of the transcription factor EGR1. We compared molecular signatures across the three brain regions and disorders in the transcriptomes of post-mortem human brain samples. The most significant disease-related differences were in the anterior cingulate cortex of schizophrenia samples compared to controls. Transcriptional changes were assessed in an independent cohort, revealing the transcription factor EGR1 as significantly down-regulated in both cohorts and as a potential regulator of broader transcription changes observed in schizophrenia patients. Additionally, broad down-regulation of genes specific to neurons and concordant up-regulation of genes specific to astrocytes was observed in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients relative to controls. Metabolomic profiling identified disruption of GABA levels in schizophrenia patients. We provide a comprehensive post-mortem transcriptome profile of three psychiatric disorders across three brain regions. We highlight a high-confidence set of independently validated genes differentially expressed between schizophrenia and control patients in the anterior cingulate cortex and integrate transcriptional changes with untargeted metabolite profiling.},

abstract = {Apply BCM theory to various scenarios (monocular deprivation, strabismus). input from LGN is noise + patterns. Multiple patterns are used. the patterns in the two eyes are either equal or uncorrelated. They discuss the role of the spontaneous activities. Threshold is driven by the square of the mean of the actual cortical firing rate (with spontaneous rate included) (not the mean of the square as in Intrator et al). 1. The aim of this work was to assess whether a form of synaptic modification based on the theory of Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) can, with a fixed set of parameters, reproduce both the kinetics and equilibrium states of experience-dependent modifications that have been observed experimentally in kitten striate cortex. 2. According to the BCM theory, the connection strength of excitatory geniculocortical synapses varies as the product of a measure of input activity (d) and a function (phi) of the summed postsynaptic response. For all postsynaptic responses greater than spontaneous but less than a critical value called the "modification threshold" (theta), phi has a negative value. For all postsynaptic responses greater than theta, phi has a positive value. A novel feature of the BCM theory is that the value of theta is not fixed, but rather "slides" as a nonlinear function of the average postsynaptic response. 3. This theory permits precise specification of theoretical equivalents of experimental situations, allowing detailed, quantitative comparisons of theory with experiment. Such comparisons were carried out here in a series of computer simulations. 4. Simulations are performed by presenting input to a model cortical neuron, calculating the summed postsynaptic response, and then changing the synaptic weights according to the BCM theory. This process is repeated until the synaptic weights reach an equilibrium state. 5. Two types of geniculocortical input are simulated: "pattern" and "noise." Pattern input is assumed to correspond to the type of input that arises when a visual contour of a particular orientation is presented to the retina. This type of input is said to be "correlated" when the two sets of geniculocortical fibers relaying information from the two eyes convey the same patterns at the same time. Noise input is assumed to correspond to the type of input that arises in the absence of visual contours and, by definition, is uncorrelated. 6. By varying the types of input available to the two sets of geniculocortical synapses, we simulate the following types of visual experience: 1) normal binocular contour vision, 2) monocular deprivation, 3) reverse suture, 4) strabismus, 5) binocular deprivation, and 6) normal contour vision after a period of monocular deprivation. 7. The constraints placed on the set of parameters by each type of simulated visual environment, and the effects that such constraints have on the evolution of the synaptic weights, are investigated in detail. 8. It was discovered that the exact form and dependencies of the sliding modification threshold are critical in obtaining a set of simulations that are consistent with the experimentally observed kinetics of synaptic modification in visual cortex. In particular, to account for observed changes during reverse suture and binocular deprivation, the value of theta could approach zero only when the synaptic strengths were driven to very low values. In the present model, this was achieved by including in the calculation of theta the postsynaptic responses generated by spontaneous input activity. 9. It is concluded that the modification of excitatory geniculocortical synapses according to rules derived from the BCM theory can account for both the outcome and kinetics of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity in kitten striate cortex. The understanding that this theory provides should be useful for the design of neurophysiological experiments aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms in play during the modification of visual cortex by experience.

abstract = {Recent findings have elucidated that the regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) levels is due to the synergistic and antagonist actions of transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Mutual interactions among these molecules are easily modeled and analyzed using graphs whose nodes are molecules, and directed edges represent the associations among them. In particular, small subgraphs having three nodes also referred to as feed-forward loops (FFLs) or regulatory loops play a crucial role in many different diseases, such as cancer. Available technological platforms enable the investigation of only a single aspect of these mechanisms, e.g., the quantification of levels of mRNA or miRNA. Consequently, there exist different data sources for investigating some aspects of this problem, e.g., miRNA-mRNA or TF-mRNA associations. The comprehensive analysis is made possible only by the integration and the analysis of these data sources. Currently, the interest of researchers in this area is growing, the number of projects is increasing, and the number of challenges and issues for computer scientists is considerable. The need for an introductive survey from a computer science point of view consequently arises. This survey starts by discussing general concepts related to production of data. Then, main existing approaches of analysis are presented and discussed. Future improvements and challenges are also discussed.},

abstract = {Tau is a highly abundant and multifunctional brain protein that accumulates in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), most commonly in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and primary age-related tauopathy. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been linked to neurodegeneration; however, it is not clear whether miRNA dysregulation contributes to tau neurotoxicity. Here, we determined that the highly conserved brain miRNA miR-219 is downregulated in brain tissue taken at autopsy from patients with AD and from those with severe primary age-related tauopathy. In a Drosophila model that produces human tau, reduction of miR-219 exacerbated tau toxicity, while overexpression of miR-219 partially abrogated toxic effects. Moreover, we observed a bidirectional modulation of tau levels in the Drosophila model that was dependent on miR-219 expression or neutralization, demonstrating that miR-219 regulates tau in vivo. In mammalian cellular models, we found that miR-219 binds directly to the 3'-UTR of the tau mRNA and represses tau synthesis at the post-transcriptional level. Together, our data indicate that silencing of tau by miR-219 is an ancient regulatory mechanism that may become perturbed during neurofibrillary degeneration and suggest that this regulatory pathway may be useful for developing therapeutics for tauopathies.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA-Seq is a promising new technology for accurately measuring gene expression levels. Expression estimation with RNA-Seq requires the mapping of relatively short sequencing reads to a reference genome or transcript set. Because reads are generally shorter than transcripts from which they are derived, a single read may map to multiple genes and isoforms, complicating expression analyses. Previous computational methods either discard reads that map to multiple locations or allocate them to genes heuristically. RESULTS: We present a generative statistical model and associated inference methods that handle read mapping uncertainty in a principled manner. Through simulations parameterized by real RNA-Seq data, we show that our method is more accurate than previous methods. Our improved accuracy is the result of handling read mapping uncertainty with a statistical model and the estimation of gene expression levels as the sum of isoform expression levels. Unlike previous methods, our method is capable of modeling non-uniform read distributions. Simulations with our method indicate that a read length of 20-25 bases is optimal for gene-level expression estimation from mouse and maize RNA-Seq data when sequencing throughput is fixed.},

abstract = {Objective: Density of sympathetic nerve fibers decreases in inflamed arthritic tissue tested by immunoreactivity towards tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH, catecholaminergic key enzyme). Since sympathetic nerve fibers may change phenotype from catecholaminergic to cholinergic (example: sweat glands), loss of nerve fibers may relate to undetectable TH. We aimed to investigate possible catecholaminergic-to-cholinergic transition of sympathetic nerve fibers in synovial tissue of animals with arthritis, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), and we wanted to find a possible transition factor. Methods: Nerve fibers were detected by immunofluorescence towards TH (catecholaminergic) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (cholinergic). Co-culture experiments with sympathetic ganglia and lymphocytes or osteoclast progenitors were designed to find stimulators of catecholaminergic-to-cholinergic transition (including gene expression profiling).Results: In mouse joints, an increased density of cholinergic relative to catecholaminergic nerve fibers appeared towards day 35 after immunization, but most nerve fibers were located in healthy joint-adjacent skin or muscle and almost none in inflamed synovial tissue. In humans, cholinergic fibers are more prevalent in OA synovial tissue than in RA. Co-culture of sympathetic ganglia with osteoclast progenitors obtained from healthy but not from arthritic animals induced catecholaminergic-to-cholinergic transition. Osteoclast mRNA microarray data indicated that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a candidate transition factor, which was confirmed in ganglia experiments, particularly, in the presence of progesterone.Conclusion: In humans and mice, catecholaminergic-to-cholinergic sympathetic transition happens in less inflamed tissue but not in inflamed arthritic tissue. Under healthy conditions, presence of cholinergic sympathetic nerve fibers may support the cholinergic anti-inflammatory influence recently described.},

abstract = {The human body hosts an enormous abundance and diversity of microbes, which perform a range of essential and beneficial functions. Our appreciation of the importance of these microbial communities to many aspects of human physiology has grown dramatically in recent years. We know, for example, that animals raised in a germ-free environment exhibit substantially altered immune and metabolic function, while the disruption of commensal microbiota in humans is associated with the development of a growing number of diseases. Evidence is now emerging that, through interactions with the gut–brain axis, the bidirectional communication system between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract, the gut microbiome can also influence neural development, cognition and behaviour, with recent evidence that changes in behaviour alter gut microbiota composition, while modifications of the microbiome can induce depressive-like behaviours. Although an association between enteropathy and certain psychiatric conditions has long been recognized, it now appears that gut microbes represent direct mediators of psychopathology. Here, we examine roles of gut microbiome in shaping brain development and neurological function, and the mechanisms by which it can contribute to mental illness. Further, we discuss how the insight provided by this new and exciting field of research can inform care and provide a basis for the design of novel, microbiota-targeted, therapies.},

abstract = {Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, but no clear disease-initiating mechanism is known. A$\beta$ deposits and neuronal tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau are characteristic for AD. Here, we analyze the contribution of microRNA-125b (miR-125b), which is elevated in AD. In primary neurons, overexpression of miR-125b causes tau hyperphosphorylation and an upregulation of p35, cdk5, and p44/42-MAPK signaling. In parallel, the phosphatases DUSP6 and PPP1CA and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-W are downregulated as direct targets of miR-125b. Knockdown of these phosphatases induces tau hyperphosphorylation, and overexpression of PPP1CA and Bcl-W prevents miR-125b-induced tau phosphorylation, suggesting that they mediate the effects of miR-125b on tau. Conversely, suppression of miR-125b in neurons by tough decoys reduces tau phosphorylation and kinase expression/activity. Injecting miR-125b into the hippocampus of mice impairs associative learning and is accompanied by downregulation of Bcl-W, DUSP6, and PPP1CA, resulting in increased tau phosphorylation in vivo. Importantly, DUSP6 and PPP1CA are also reduced in AD brains. These data implicate miR-125b in the pathogenesis of AD by promoting pathological tau phosphorylation.},

abstract = {ABCD1 is a gene responsible for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), and is critical for the transport of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) into peroxisomes and subsequent $\beta$-oxidation. VLCFA-containing lipids accumulate in X-ALD patients, although the effect of ABCD1-deficiency on each lipid species in the central nervous system has not been fully characterized. In this study, each phospholipid and lysophospholipid species in Abcd1-deficient mice brains were profiled by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Among the phospholipid and lysophospholipid species that are significantly more enriched in Abcd1-deficient mice brains, VLCFA were present in 75, 15, 5, 4, and 1 species of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidylcholine, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine, respectively. Most VLCFA were incorporated at the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Among the phospholipid species that are significantly less enriched in Abcd1-deficient mice brains, odd-numbered saturated or mono-unsaturated fatty acyl moieties are contained in all phosphatidylcholine species. In addition, a number of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine species contained highly unsaturated fatty acyl moieties. Intriguingly, 44:1 phosphatidylcholine with VLCFA was mainly distributed in the gray matter, such as the cortex, but not in the white matter in the cerebrum and cerebellum. These results show that ABCD1-deficiency causes metabolic alternation of long-chain fatty acids and VLCFA. Moreover, our results imply a molecular mechanism for the incorporation of saturated or monounsaturated VLCFA into the sn-1 position of phospholipids, and also indicate that the distribution of phospholipids with VLCFA may correlate with the development of X-ALD.},

abstract = {It is generally agreed that hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) is synthesized and released exclusively from the terminals of the long-axon afferents whose cell bodies reside in the medial septum and diagonal band. The search for intrinsic cholinergic neurons in the hippocampus has a long history; however evidence for the existence of these neurons has been inconsistent, with most investigators failing to detect them using in situ hybridization or immunohistochemical staining of the cholinergic markers, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) or vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). Advances in the use of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice expressing a reporter protein under the control of the genomic elements of the Chat gene (Chat-BAC mice) have facilitated studies of cholinergic neurons. Such mice show robust and faithful expression of the reporter proteins in all known cholinergic cell populations. The availability of the Chat-BAC mice re-ignited interest in hippocampal cholinergic interneurons, because a small number of such reporter-expressing cells is frequently observed in the hippocampus of these mice. However, to date, attempts to confirm that these neurons co-express the endogenous cholinergic marker ChAT, or release ACh, have been unsuccessful. Without such confirmatory evidence it is best to conclude that there are no cholinergic neurons in the hippocampus. Similar considerations apply to other BAC transgenic lines, whose utility as a discovery tool for cell populations heretofore not known to express the genes of interest encoded by the BACs, must be validated by methods that detect expression of the endogenous genes.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can notably control many targets each and regulate entire cellular pathways, but whether miRNAs can regulate complete neurotransmission processes is largely unknown. Here, we report that miRNAs with complementary sequence motifs to the key genes involved in acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis and/or packaging show massive overlap with those regulating ACh degradation. To address this topic, we first searched for miRNAs that could target the 3'-untranslated regions of the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) gene that controls ACh synthesis; the vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT), encoded from an intron in the ChAT gene and the ACh hydrolyzing genes acetyl- and/or butyrylcholinesterase (AChE, BChE). Intriguingly, we found that many of the miRNAs targeting these genes are primate-specific, and that changes in their levels associate with inflammation, anxiety, brain damage, cardiac, neurodegenerative, or pain-related syndromes. To validate the in vivo relevance of this dual interaction, we selected the evolutionarily conserved miR-186, which targets both the stress-inducible soluble "readthrough" variant AChE-R and the major peripheral cholinesterase BChE. We exposed mice to predator scent stress and searched for potential associations between consequent changes in their miR-186, AChE-R, and BChE levels. Both intestinal miR-186 as well as BChE and AChE-R activities were conspicuously elevated 1 week post-exposure, highlighting the previously unknown involvement of miR-186 and BChE in psychological stress responses. Overlapping miRNA regulation emerges from our findings as a recently evolved surveillance mechanism over cholinergic neurotransmission in health and disease; and the corresponding miRNA details and disease relevance may serve as a useful resource for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying this surveillance.},

abstract = {Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has emerged as a therapeutic target for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). PCSK9 increases the degradation of the LDL receptor, resulting in high LDL-C in individuals with high PCSK9 activity. Here, we show that two locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotides targeting PCSK9 produce sustained reduction of LDL-C in nonhuman primates after a loading dose (20 mg/kg) and four weekly maintenance doses (5 mg/kg). PCSK9 messenger RNA (mRNA) and serum PCSK9 protein were reduced by 85{\%} which resulted in a 50{\%} reduction in circulating LDL-C. Serum total cholesterol (TC) levels were reduced to the same extent as LDL-C with no reduction in high-density lipoprotein levels, demonstrating a specific pharmacological effect on LDL-C. The reduction in hepatic PCSK9 mRNA correlated with liver LNA oligonucleotide content. This verified that anti-PCSK9 LNA oligonucleotides regulated LDL-C through an antisense mechanism. The compounds were well tolerated with no observed effects on toxicological parameters (liver and kidney histology, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, urea, and creatinine). The pharmacologic evidence and initial safety profile of the compounds used in this study indicate that LNA antisense oligonucleotides targeting PCSK9 provide a viable therapeutic strategy and are potential complements to statins in managing high LDL-C.},

Published by John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd Objectives: Overlapping neural system dysfunctions, mainly involving the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the anterior insular cortex (AIC), seem to be related to both pain-perception abnormalities and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) were used to investigate pain-perception and central pain-processing abnormalities in SCZ, bipolar I disorder (BD-I), and bipolar II disorder (BD-II), and to evaluate their relationship with history of psychosis, and social-cognitive and functional impairments. Methods: Twenty patients with SCZ, 17 patients with BD-I, and 21 patients with BD-II who were all under similar pharmacological treatment underwent clinical, functional, and neuro-psychological assessment. LEPs were analyzed in patients and 19 healthy subjects (HS). LEPs elicit responses reflecting the activity of the S2 (N1 wave) and the ACC/AIC cortices (N2/P2 complex). A four-group ANOVA was conducted between patients and HS to compare pain-perceptive thresholds (PThs), N1, and N2/P2-LEP components. Results: Compared to HS: (i) patients with SCZ showed pain-processing and pain-perception abnormalities, as revealed by significantly higher PTh (P {\textless} .01), and lower N1 (P {\textless} .01) and N2/P2 (P {\textless} .01) amplitudes, (ii) patients with BD-I showed only pain-processing abnormalities, as revealed by significantly lower N1 (P {\textless} .05) and N2 (P {\textless} .01) amplitudes; and patients with BD-II did not differ for any of the LEP variables investigated. N1 and N2 amplitudes negatively correlated to history of psychosis (P {\textless} .01), social-cognition (P {\textless} .05), and real-world functioning (P {\textless} .01) measures in the whole group of patients. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study comparing central pain processing in patients with SCZ, BD-I, and BD-II. Our results suggest that pain-processing abnormalities may represent a novel locus of interest for research investigating trait markers of the psychosis spectrum.},

abstract = {We have described recently an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) knockout mouse. While comparing the tissue distribution of AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), we found that extraction buffers containing Triton X-100 strongly inhibited mouse BChE activity. In contrast, buffers with Tween 20 caused no inhibition of BChE. Conventional techniques grossly underestimated BChE activity by up to 15-fold. In Tween 20 buffer, the intestine, serum, lung, liver, and heart had higher BChE than AChE activity. Only brain had higher AChE than BChE activity in AChE mice. These findings contradict the dogma, based mainly on observations in Triton X-100 extracts, that BChE is a minor cholinesterase in animal tissues. AChE mice had 50{\%} of normal AChE activity and AChE mice had none, but all mice had similar levels of BChE activity. BChE was inhibited by Triton X-100 in all species tested, except rat and chicken. Inhibition was reversible and competitive with substrate binding. The active site of rat BChE was unique, having an arginine in place of leucine at position 286 (human BChE numbering) in the acyl-binding pocket of the active site, thus explaining the lack of inhibition of rat BChE by Triton X-100. The generally high levels of BChE activity in tissues, including the motor endplate, and the observation that mice live without AChE, suggest that BChE has an essential function in nullizygous mice and probably in wild-type mice as well.},

abstract = {Staurosporine is one of the best apoptotic inducers in different cell types including neuroblastomas. In this study we have compared the efficiency and final outcome of three different anti-apoptotic strategies in staurosporine-treated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. At staurosporine concentrations up to 500 nm, z-VAD.fmk a broad-spectrum, noncompetitive inhibitor of caspases, reduced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. At higher concentrations, z-VAD.fmk continued to inhibit caspases and the apoptotic phenotype but not cell death which seems to result from oxidative damage. Stable over-expression of Bcl-2 in SH-SY5Y protected cells from death at doses of staurosporine up to 1 microm. At higher doses, cytochrome c release from mitochondria occurred, caspases were activated and cells died by apoptosis. Therefore, we conclude that Bcl-2 increased the threshold for apoptotic cell death commitment. Over-expression of Bcl-X(L) was far more effective than Bcl-2. Bcl-X(L) transfected cells showed a remarkable resistance staurosporine-induced cytochrome c release and associated apoptotic changes and survived for up to 15 days in 1 microm staurosporine. In these conditions, SH-SY5Y displayed a remarkable phenotype of neuronal differentiation as assessed by neurite outgrowth and expression of neurofilament, Tau and MAP-2 neuronal specific proteins.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive phenotypic downregulation of markers within cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) neurons, frank CBF cell loss and reduced cortical choline acetyltransferase activity associated with cognitive decline. Delaying CBF neurodegeneration or minimizing its consequences is the mechanism of action for most currently available drug treatments for cognitive dysfunction in AD. Growing evidence suggests that imbalances in the expression of NGF, its precursor proNGF and the high (TrkA) and low (p75(NTR)) affinity NGF receptors are crucial factors underlying CBF dysfunction in AD. Drugs that maintain a homeostatic balance between TrkA and p75(NTR) may slow the onset of AD. A NGF gene therapy trial reduced cognitive decline and stimulated cholinergic fiber growth in humans with mild AD. Drugs treating the multiple pathologies and clinical symptoms in AD (e.g., M1 cholinoceptor and/or galaninergic drugs) should be considered for a more comprehensive treatment approach for cholinergic dysfunction.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair to sites in mRNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. Many sites that match the miRNA seed (nucleotides 2-7), particularly those in 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs), are preferentially conserved. Here, we overhauled our tool for finding preferential conservation of sequence motifs and applied it to the analysis of human 3'UTRs, increasing by nearly threefold the detected number of preferentially conserved miRNA target sites. The new tool more efficiently incorporates new genomes and more completely controls for background conservation by accounting for mutational biases, dinucleotide conservation rates, and the conservation rates of individual UTRs. The improved background model enabled preferential conservation of a new site type, the "offset 6mer," to be detected. In total, {\textgreater}45,000 miRNA target sites within human 3'UTRs are conserved above background levels, and {\textgreater}60{\%} of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs. Mammalian-specific miRNAs have far fewer conserved targets than do the more broadly conserved miRNAs, even when considering only more recently emerged targets. Although pairing to the 3' end of miRNAs can compensate for seed mismatches, this class of sites constitutes less than 2{\%} of all preferentially conserved sites detected. The new tool enables statistically powerful analysis of individual miRNA target sites, with the probability of preferentially conserved targeting (P(CT)) correlating with experimental measurements of repression. Our expanded set of target predictions (including conserved 3'-compensatory sites), are available at the TargetScan website, which displays the P(CT) for each site and each predicted target.},

abstract = {Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a neural cytokine that reduces appetite and body weight when administrated to rodents or humans. We have demonstrated recently that the level of CNTF in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), a key hypothalamic region involved in food intake regulation, is positively correlated with protection against diet-induced obesity. However, the comprehension of the physiological significance of neural CNTF action was still incomplete because CNTF lacks a signal peptide and thus may not be secreted by the classical exocytosis pathways. Knowing that CNTF distribution shares similarities with that of its receptor subunits in the rat ARC, we hypothesized that CNTF could exert a direct intracrine effect in ARC cells. Here, we demonstrate that CNTF, together with its receptor subunits, translocates to the cell nucleus of anorexigenic POMC neurons in the rat ARC. Furthermore, the stimulation of hypothalamic nuclear fractions with CNTF induces the phosphorylation of several signaling proteins, including Akt, as well as the transcription of the POMC gene. These data strongly suggest that intracellular CNTF may directly modulate POMC gene expression via the activation of receptors localized in the cell nucleus, providing a novel plausible mechanism of CNTF action in regulating energy homeostasis.},

To determine potential roles of GRK5 in the disease pathogenesis, the GRK5 knockout mouse was evaluated at pathological and behavioral levels. We found that these mice displayed an age-dependent increase in hippocampal axonal defects characterized by clusters of axonal swellings that accumulated abnormal amounts of molecular motor proteins, microtubule-associated proteins, intracellular beta-amyloid, and subcellular organelles. In severe cases, extracellular beta-amyloid fibrillar deposits were occasionally observed, along with degenerating axonal components, and were tightly surrounded by reactive astrocytes. Moreover, significant loss of synaptic proteins and early signs of cholinoceptive neurodegeneration were evident in the hippocampus as well. Consistent with the moderate level of pathologic change, aged GRK5 knockout mice displayed selective working memory impairment, with other cognitive domains unaffected. Taken together, these findings not only strongly support an important role of GRK5 deficiency in early Alzheimer's pathogenesis, but also promote the GRK5 knockout mouse as an additional model for early Alzheimer-related studies.},

However, miRNAs operate nonuniformly upon the transcriptional profile with an as yet unknown logic. Shortcomings in defining miRNA-mRNA networks include limited knowledge of in vivo miRNA targets and their abundance in single cells. By combining multiple complementary approaches, high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation with an antibody to AGO2 (AGO2-HITS-CLIP), single-cell profiling and computational analyses using bipartite and coexpression networks, we show that miRNA-mRNA interactions operate as functional modules that often correspond to cell-type identities and undergo dynamic transitions during brain development. These networks are highly dynamic during development and over the course of evolution. One such interaction is between radial-glia-enriched ORC4 and miR-2115, a great-ape-specific miRNA, which appears to control radial glia proliferation rates during human brain development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Primary craniofacial hyperhidrosis (CH) can have a profoundly negative impact on quality of life. No comprehensive review of its management exists. OBJECTIVE The objective of this review is to present the best clinical evidence to guide CH management. METHODS A systematic review was performed using PRISMA guidelines. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1966 to 2014 for articles using the MeSH terms "Hyperhidrosis", "Head", "Neck" and synonymous text words. Inclusion criteria were experimental and observational studies addressing CH treatment. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality and analysed data. RESULTS Of 833 references yielded, 27 met inclusion criteria and were analysed. Twenty-two studies evaluated T2 sympathetic ablation (Level III evidence). Outcome measures were subjective and mean follow-up was 29 months. Reported efficacy was high (70-100{\%}), recurrence rates were generally low (0-8{\%}) and complications largely transient (e.g. pneumothorax 0-1{\%}). However, 8-95.4{\%} experienced troubling compensatory sweating. One randomised controlled trial and one observational study evaluated botulinum toxin A (Level Ib and III, respectively). Both employed objective outcome measures and demonstrated similar findings. Efficacy was 100{\%}, lasted a median of 5-6 months and frontalis muscle inhibition was the main adverse effect (50-100{\%}). Three studies evaluated anticholinergic therapy: topical glycopyrrolate demonstrated high efficacy (96{\%}) with minimal adverse effects (Level Ib) and oral oxybutynin demonstrated relatively high efficacy (80-100{\%}) but with noticeable adverse effects (76.6-83.6{\%}) (Level III). CONCLUSION There are few quality studies evaluating CH treatment. Based on available evidence, we recommend topical glycopyrrolate, oral oxybutynin and intradermal botulinum toxin A as first-line therapies due to their efficacy and safety. T2 sympathectomy should be considered for patients refractory to first-line therapy.},

abstract = {Morphological and functional changes in the enteric nervous system (ENS) have been reported in inflammatory bowel disease. We examined the effects of inflammation on the expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and nNOS in the muscularis externae of two models of colonic inflammation, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, which models Crohn's disease-like inflammation, and DSS-induced colitis, which models ulcerative Colitis-like inflammation. In TNBS colitis, we observed significant decline in ChAT, nNOS, and protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 protein and mRNA levels. In DSS colitis, ChAT and PGP9.5 were significantly upregulated while nNOS levels did not change. The nNOS dimer-to-monomer ratio decreased significantly in DSS- but not in TNBS-induced colitis. No differences were observed in the percentage of either ChAT (31 vs. 33{\%})- or nNOS (37 vs. 41{\%})-immunopositive neurons per ganglia or the mean number of neurons per ganglia (55 +/- 5 vs. 59 +/- 5, P {\textgreater} 0.05). Incubation of the distal colon muscularis externae in vitro with different types of inflammatory mediators showed that cytokines decreased ChAT and nNOS expression, whereas H2O2, a component of oxidative stress, increased their expression. NF-kappaB inhibitor MG-132 did not prevent the IL-1beta-induced decline in either ChAT or nNOS expression. These findings showed that TNBS- and DSS-induced inflammation differentially regulates the expression of two critical proteins expressed in the colonic myenteric neurons. These differences are likely due to the exposure of the myenteric plexus neurons to different combinations of Th1-type inflammatory mediators and H2O2 in each model.},

Myelinating glia express all the major types of muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors at different stages of development, and acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase are highly expressed in white matter. This review traces the history of research on ACh signaling in Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes, and in the myelin sheath, and summarizes current knowledge on the intracellular signaling and functional consequences of ACh signaling in myelinating glia. Implications of ACh in diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and white matter toxicity caused by pesticides are considered, together with an outline of major questions for future research.

Z-DNA/RNA is recognised by Z-binding domains (ZBDs), which are present in proteins implicated in antiviral immunity. These include ZBP1 (also known as DAI or DLM-1), which induces necroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death. Using reconstitution and knock-in models, we report that mutation of key amino acids involved in Z-DNA/RNA binding in ZBP1's ZBDs prevented necroptosis upon infection with mouse cytomegalovirus. Induction of cell death was cell autonomous and required RNA synthesis but not viral DNA replication. Accordingly, ZBP1 directly bound to RNA via its ZBDs. Intact ZBP1-ZBDs were also required for necroptosis triggered by ectopic expression of ZBP1 and caspase blockade, and ZBP1 cross-linked to endogenous RNA These observations show that Z-RNA may constitute a molecular pattern that induces inflammatory cell death upon sensing by ZBP1.},

abstract = {Macrophages play pivotal roles in the progression and regression of atherosclerosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that macrophage polarization into an anti-inflammatory M2 state is a key characteristic of atherosclerotic plaques undergoing regression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this potential association of the M2 polarization with atherosclerosis regression remain poorly understood. Further, human genetic factors that facilitate these anti-atherogenic processes remain largely unknown. We report that the transcription factor MafB plays pivotal roles in promoting macrophage M2 polarization. Further, MafB promotes cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells by directly up-regulating its key cellular mediators. Notably, MafB expression is significantly up-regulated in response to various metabolic and immunological stimuli that promote macrophage M2 polarization or cholesterol efflux, and thereby MafB mediates their beneficial effects, in both liver x receptor (LXR)-dependent and independent manners. In contrast, MafB is strongly down-regulated upon elevated pro-inflammatory signaling or by pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic microRNAs, miR-155 and miR-33. Using an integrative systems biology approach, we also revealed that M2 polarization and cholesterol efflux do not necessarily represent inter-dependent events, but MafB is broadly involved in both the processes. These findings highlight physiological protective roles that MafB may play against atherosclerosis progression.},

abstract = {Introduction: Video-assisted thoracic sympathectomy provides excellent resolution of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis but is associated with compensatory hyperhidrosis. Low doses of oxybutynin, an anticholinergic medication that competitively antagonizes the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, can be used to treat palmar hyperhidrosis with fewer side effects. Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness and patient satisfaction of oral oxybutynin at low doses (5 mg twice daily) compared with placebo for treating palmar hyperhidrosis. Methods: This was prospective, randomized, and controlled study. From December 2010 to February 2011, 50 consecutive patients with palmar hyperhidrosis were treated with oxybutynin or placebo. Data were collected from 50 patients, but 5 (10.0{\%}) were lost to follow-up. During the first week, patients received 2.5 mg of oxybutynin once daily in the evening. From days 8 to 21, they received 2.5 mg twice daily, and from day 22 to the end of week 6, they received 5 mg twice daily. All patients underwent two evaluations, before and after (6 weeks) the oxybutynin treatment, using a clinical questionnaire and a clinical protocol for quality of life. Results: Palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis improved in {\textgreater}70{\%} of the patients, and 47.8{\%} of those presented great improvement. Plantar hyperhidrosis improved in {\textgreater}90{\%} of the patients. Most patients (65.2{\%}) showed improvements in their quality of life. The side effects were minor, with dry mouth being the most frequent (47.8{\%}). Conclusions: Treatment of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis with oxybutynin is a good initial alternative for treatment given that it presents good results and improves quality of life. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Vascular Surgery.},

abstract = {Developing microRNA therapeutics for neurological diseases is both a promising opportunity and an extremely challenging topic for several reasons. The promise stems from the very small size of microRNAs, which makes them amenable for manipulation via short synthetic oligonucleotides or engineered viruses. Also, the fact that each microRNA may regulate numerous target transcripts of the same pathway predicts that such manipulations may affect an entire pathway rather than a single gene and gives reason to hope that low dose therapeutic targeting of the top microRNA in such a hierarchic pyramid would suffice to induce a focused change in the entire pyramid. However, these same features, which make microRNAs such promising targets for therapeutic manipulations also present great challenges. Thus the plethora of functional targets for each microRNA in specific cell types is yet far from being elucidated, which implies that the targets to be affected may not be those planned to be manipulated (a risk of 'off-target' effects). Also, the hierarchic order of microRNA regulation is yet unknown, which predicts a risk of complex, multi-leveled consequences following the manipulation of a single microRNA; and the delivery of oligonucleotide therapeutics into the brain is a challenge due to the blood-brain barrier. In this chapter, we briefly outline the current state of knowledge regarding microRNA regulation in different neuropathologies and sketch the emerging principles for the development of microRNA therapeutics for these diseases.We address issues such as modes of delivery and consideration of the inherited and acquired variability between individuals in the susceptibility to such treatments. We further refer in a somewhat more in-depth manner to the issue of manipulating microRNA functioning in the parasympathetic system and the pathway of cholinergic signaling. Beyond the brain and within it, cholinergic signaling controls inflammatory reactions, and microRNA changes would likely affect this function as well. Furthermore, microRNA regulation of cholinergic signaling involves the elements of complexity and hierarchy noted above, and is relevant to numerous neuropathologies and neurodegenerative syndromes. Research and translational efforts that lead to the development of microRNA therapeutics merit thorough discussion.},

abstract = {The gene of mammalian acetylcholinesterase (AChE) generates multiple molecular forms, by alternative splicing of its transcripts and association of the tailed variant (AChET) with structural proteins. In the mammalian brain, the major AChE species consists of AChET tetramers anchored to the cell membrane of neurons by the PRiMA protein (Perrier et al., 2002). Stress and anticholinesterase inhibitors have been reported to induce rapid and long-lasting expression of the readthrough variant (AChER) in the mouse brain (Kaufer et al., 1998). In the readthrough transcript, there is no splicing after the last exon encoding the catalytic domain, so that the entire alternatively spliced 3' region is maintained. It encodes a C-terminal peptide with no specific interaction properties: COS cells transfected with AChER produce a soluble, nonamphiphilic monomeric form. We quantified AChER and total AChE expression in the mouse brain after an immobilization stress and after heat shock in neuroblastoma cells, and compared the observed effects with those induced by irreversible AChE inhibition (Perrier et al., 2005).},

Many miRNAs are dynamically regulated during central nervous system (CNS) development and are spatially expressed in adult brain indicating their essential roles in neural development and function. In addition, accumulating evidence strongly suggests that dysfunction of miRNAs contributes to neurological diseases. These observations, together with their gene regulation property, implicated miRNAs to be the key regulators in the complex genetic network of the CNS. In this review, we first focus on the ways through which miRNAs exert the regulatory function and how miRNAs are regulated in the CNS. We then summarize recent findings that highlight the versatile roles of miRNAs in normal CNS physiology and their association with several types of neurological diseases. Subsequently we discuss the limitations of miRNAs research based on current studies as well as the potential therapeutic applications and challenges of miRNAs in neurological disorders. We endeavor to provide an updated description of the regulatory roles of miRNAs in normal CNS functions and pathogenesis of neurological diseases.},

Depleted hepatic vitamin A content has been reported in human alcoholics, an observation that has been confirmed in animal models of chronic alcohol consumption. Indeed, alcohol consumption has been associated with declines in hepatic levels of retinol (vitamin A), as well as retinyl ester and retinoic acid; collectively referred to as retinoids. Through the use of animal models, the complex interplay between alcohol metabolism and vitamin A homeostasis has been studied; the reviewed research supports the notion that chronic alcohol consumption precipitates a decline in hepatic retinoid levels through increased breakdown, as well as increased export to extra-hepatic tissues. While the precise biochemical mechanisms governing alcohol's effect remain to be elucidated, its profound effect on hepatic retinoid status is irrefutable. In addition to a review of the literature related to studies on tissue retinoid levels and the metabolic interactions between alcohol and retinoids, the significance of altered hepatic retinoid metabolism in the context of alcoholic liver disease is also considered.},

Understanding the organization of the cholinergic system requires a complete map of cholinergic neurons and their axon arborizations throughout the entire brain at the level of single neurons. Here, we report a comprehensive whole-brain atlas of the cholinergic system originating from various cortical and subcortical regions of the mouse brain. Using genetically labeled cholinergic neurons together with whole-brain reconstruction of optical images at 2-$\mu$m resolution, we obtained quantification of the number and soma volume of cholinergic neurons in 22 brain areas. Furthermore, by reconstructing the complete axonal arbors of fluorescently labeled single neurons from a subregion of the basal forebrain at 1-$\mu$m resolution, we found that their projections to the forebrain and midbrain showed neuronal subgroups with distinct projection specificity and diverse arbor distribution within the same projection area. These results suggest the existence of distinct subtypes of cholinergic neurons that serve different regulatory functions in the brain and illustrate the usefulness of complete reconstruction of neuronal distribution and axon projections at the mesoscopic level.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease has long been known to involve cholinergic deficits, but the linkage between cholinergic gene expression and the Alzheimer's disease amyloid pathology has remained incompletely understood. One known link involves synaptic acetylcholinesterase (AChE-S), shown to accelerate amyloid fibrils formation. Here, we report that the 'Readthrough' AChE-R splice variant, which differs from AChE-S in its 26 C-terminal residues, inversely exerts neuroprotective effects from amyloid beta (Abeta) induced toxicity. In vitro, highly purified AChE-R dose-dependently suppressed the formation of insoluble Abeta oligomers and fibrils and abolished Abeta toxicity to cultured cells, competing with the prevalent AChE-S protein which facilitates these processes. In vivo, double transgenic APPsw/AChE-R mice showed lower plaque burden, fewer reactive astrocytes and less dendritic damage than single APPsw mice, inverse to reported acceleration of these features in double APPsw/AChE-S mice. In hippocampi from Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 10), dentate gyrus neurons showed significantly elevated AChE-R mRNA and reduced AChE-S mRNA. However, immunoblot analyses revealed drastic reductions in the levels of intact AChE-R protein, suggesting that its selective loss in the Alzheimer's disease brain exacerbates the Abeta-induced damages and revealing a previously unforeseen linkage between cholinergic and amyloidogenic events.},

Both of these nuclear factor kappa B (NF-$\kappa$B)-activated, 22 nucleotide small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) target the mRNA of the key, innate-immune- and inflammation-related regulatory protein, complement factor-H (CFH; chr 1q32), resulting in significant decreases in CFH expression (p{\textless}0.01, ANOVA). Our results further indicate that HNG cells respond to IL-1$\beta$+A$\beta$42-peptide-induced stress by significant NF-$\kappa$B-modulated up-regulation of miRNA-125b- and miRNA-146a. The complex interactive signaling of NF-$\kappa$B, miR-125b, miR-146a, and perhaps other miRNAs, further illustrate interplay between inducible transcription factors and multiple pro-inflammatory sncRNAs that regulate CFH expression. The novel concept of miRNA actions involving mRNA target convergence and divergence are proposed and discussed. The combinatorial use of NF-кB inhibitors with anti-miRNAs (AMs; antagomirs) may have potential against CFH-driven pathogenic signaling in neurodegenerative disease, and may redirect our therapeutic perspectives to novel treatment strategies that have not yet been considered.},

In the brain, the RISC pathway is involved in neuronal functions, such as synaptic development and local protein synthesis, which are potentially critical for memory. In this study, we examined the role of RISC in memory formation in rodents, by silencing AGO2 expression in dorsal hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice and submitting animals to hippocampus-related tasks. One week after surgery, AGO2 downregulation impaired both short-term and long-term contextual fear memories. Conversely, no long-lasting effects were observed three weeks after surgery, when AGO2 levels were re-established. These results show that altered RISC activity severely affects learning and memory processes in rodents. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It is now well recognized that current cell culture methodologies are limited in their ability to recapitulate the cellular environment that is present in vivo, and there is a growing body of evidence to show that three-dimensional (3D) culture systems represent a more physiologically accurate model than traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures. Given the complexity of the environment from which cells originate, and their various cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions, it is important to develop models that can be controlled and reproducible for drug discovery. 3D cell models have now been developed for almost all CNS cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocyte cells. This review will highlight a number of current and emerging techniques for the culture of astrocytes and microglia, glial cell types with a critical role in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions. We describe recent advances in glial cell culture using electrospun polymers and hydrogel macromolecules, and highlight how these novel culture environments influence astrocyte and microglial phenotypes in vitro, as compared to traditional 2D systems. These models will be explored to illuminate current trends in the techniques used to create 3D environments for application in research and drug discovery focused on astrocytes and microglial cells.},

These macromolecules have so far impaired the detailed two-dimensional electrophoresis-based proteomic analysis of articular cartilage. Here we describe a method for selective protein extraction from cartilage, which excludes proteoglycans and collagen species, thus allowing direct profiling of the protein content of cartilage by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Consistent electrophoretic patterns of more than 600 protein states were reproducibly obtained after silver staining from 500 mg of human articular cartilage from joints with diverse pathologies. The extraction yield increased when the method was applied to a chondrosarcoma sample, consistent with selective extraction of cellular components. Nearly 200 of the most intensely stained protein spots were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry after trypsin digestion. They represented 127 different proteins with diverse functions. Our method provides a rapid, efficient, and pertinent alternative to previously proposed approaches for proteomic characterization of cartilage phenotypes. It will be useful for detecting protein expression patterns that relate pathophysiological processes of cartilaginous tissues such as osteoarthritis and chondrosarcoma.},

We examined the BF circuit by recording and optogenetically perturbing the activity of four genetically defined cell types across sleep-wake cycles and by comprehensively mapping their synaptic connections. Recordings from channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-tagged neurons revealed that three BF cell types, cholinergic, glutamatergic and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) GABAergic neurons, were more active during wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (wake/REM active) than during non-REM (NREM) sleep, and activation of each cell type rapidly induced wakefulness. By contrast, activation of somatostatin-positive (SOM+) GABAergic neurons promoted NREM sleep, although only some of them were NREM active. Synaptically, the wake-promoting neurons were organized hierarchically by glutamatergic→cholinergic→PV+ neuron excitatory connections, and they all received inhibition from SOM+ neurons. Together, these findings reveal the basic organization of the BF circuit for sleep-wake control.},

The dysfunction and death of these neurons, especially in the hippocampus, are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of memory deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, studying the cholinergic properties and cell survival may help in treating this disease. We investigated the possible effects of [6]-shogaol on cholinergic signaling in HT22 hippocampal neuronal cells. HT22 cells express essential cholinergic markers, including choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and choline transporter (ChTp). HT22 cells treated with H(2)O(2) for 3h showed an increase in ROS production (35{\%}). These features were partly recovered by [6]-shogaol. Treating H(2)O(2)-treated HT22 cells with [6]-shogaol markedly increased the expression of ChAT and ChTp, an effect similar to that of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Furthermore, K-252a, an inhibitor of the BDNF receptor Trk B, attenuated the effects of both [6]-shogaol and BDNF. These data suggest that [6]-shogaol protects neurons by increasing ChAT and ChTp expression through a BDNF increase and thus may be useful for treating neurodegenerative diseases.},

To date, the approach has not been systematically validated in ground truth studies. Based on a simulated human brain data set with ground truth tracts, we organized an open international tractography challenge, which resulted in 96 distinct submissions from 20 research groups. Here, we report the encouraging finding that most state-of-the-art algorithms produce tractograms containing 90{\%} of the ground truth bundles (to at least some extent). However, the same tractograms contain many more invalid than valid bundles, and half of these invalid bundles occur systematically across research groups. Taken together, our results demonstrate and confirm fundamental ambiguities inherent in tract reconstruction based on orientation information alone, which need to be considered when interpreting tractography and connectivity results. Our approach provides a novel framework for estimating reliability of tractography and encourages innovation to address its current limitations. Though tractography is widely used, it has not been systematically validated. Here, authors report results from 20 groups showing that many tractography algorithms produce both valid and invalid bundles.},

abstract = {Within the central nervous system, microRNAs have emerged as important effectors of an array of developmental, physiological, and cognitive processes. Along these lines, the CREB-regulated microRNA miR-132 has been shown to influence neuronal maturation via its effects on dendritic arborization and spinogenesis. In the mature nervous system, dysregulation of miR-132 has been suggested to play a role in a number of neurocognitive disorders characterized by aberrant synaptogenesis. However, little is known about the inducible expression and function of miR-132 under normal physiological conditions in vivo. Here, we begin to explore this question within the context of learning and memory. Using in situ hybridization, we show that the presentation of a spatial memory task induced a significant {\~{}}1.5-fold increase in miR-132 expression within the CA1, CA3, and GCL excitatory cell layers of the hippocampus. To examine the role of miR-132 in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, we employ a doxycycline-regulated miR-132 transgenic mouse strain to drive varying levels of transgenic miR-132 expression. These studies revealed that relatively low levels of transgenic miR-132 expression, paralleling the level of expression in the hippocampus following a spatial memory task, significantly enhanced cognitive capacity. In contrast, higher (supra-physiological) levels of miR-132 ({\textgreater}3-fold) inhibited learning. Interestingly, both the impaired cognition and elevated levels of dendritic spines resulting from supra-physiological levels of transgenic miR-132 were reversed by doxycycline suppression of transgene expression. Together, these data indicate that miR-132 functions as a key activity-dependent regulator of cognition, and that miR-132 expression must be maintained within a limited range to ensure normal learning and memory formation.},

This brief review discusses evidence from neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia patients that nicotinic agonists may effectively target dysfunctional neuronal circuits in the illness. Evidence suggests that nicotine significantly modulates a number of these circuits, although relatively few studies have used modern neuroimaging techniques (e.g. functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) to examine the effects of nicotinic drugs on disease-related neurobiology. The neuronal effects of nicotine and other nicotinic agonists in schizophrenia remain a priority for psychiatry research.},

Although a single miRNA can regulate expression of hundreds of target genes, it is unclear whether any of its distinct biological functions can be due to the regulation of a single target. To explore in vivo the function of a single miRNA-mRNA interaction, we mutated the 3' UTR of a major miR-155 target (SOCS1) to specifically disrupt its regulation by miR-155. We found that under physiologic conditions and during autoimmune inflammation or viral infection, some immunological functions of miR-155 were fully or largely attributable to the regulation of SOCS1, whereas others could be accounted only partially or not at all by this interaction. Our data suggest that the role of a single miRNA-mRNA interaction is dependent on cell type and biological context.},

Recently, methods have been developed (BONCAT and FUNCAT), which introduce non-canonical amino acids bearing small bio-orthogonal functional groups into proteins using the cells' own translational machinery. Using the selective 'click reaction', this allows for the identification and visualization of newly synthesized proteins in vitro. Here we demonstrate that non-canonical amino acid labeling can be achieved in vivo in an intact organism capable of simple learning behavior, the larval zebrafish. We show that azidohomoalanine is metabolically incorporated into newly synthesized proteins, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, but has no apparent toxic effect and does not influence simple behaviors such as spontaneous swimming and escape responses. This enables fluorescent labeling of newly synthesized proteins in whole mount larval zebrafish. Furthermore, stimulation with a GABA antagonist that elicits seizures in the larval zebrafish causes an increase in protein synthesis throughout the proteome, which can also be visualized in intact larvae.},

abstract = {Since the first description of RNA interference (RNAi) in animals less than a decade ago, there has been rapid progress towards its use as a therapeutic modality against human diseases. Advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of RNAi and studies of RNAi in vivo indicate that RNAi-based therapies might soon provide a powerful new arsenal against pathogens and diseases for which treatment options are currently limited. Recent findings have highlighted both promise and challenges in using RNAi for therapeutic applications. Design and delivery strategies for RNAi effector molecules must be carefully considered to address safety concerns and to ensure effective, successful treatment of human diseases.},

abstract = {Pathological hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of the tau protein is associated with dementia and can be the central cause of neurodegeneration. Here, we examined potential alterations in the level of the cholinergic enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brain of transgenic mice (Tg-VLW) expressing human tau mutations. Overexpression of mutant hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) led to an increase in the activity of AChE in the brain of Tg-VLW mice, paralleled by an increase in AChE protein and transcripts; whereas the levels of the enzyme choline acetyltransferase remained unaffected. VLW tau overexpression in SH-SY5Y cells also increased AChE activity levels. All major molecular forms of AChE were increased in the Tg-VLW mice, including tetrameric AChE, which is the major species involved in hydrolysis of acetylcholine in the brain. Colocalization of human P-tau and AChE supports the conclusion that P-tau can act to increase AChE. This study is the first direct evidence of a modulatory effect of P-tau on brain AChE expression.},

abstract = {The dibucaine number (DN) was determined for serum cholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8, SChE) in plasma samples. The ones with a DN of 79-82 were used, because they had the "usual" SChE variant. The enzyme was assayed colorimetrically by the reaction of 5,5'-dithiobis-[2-nitrobenzoic acid] (DTNB) with the free sulfhydryl groups of thiocholine that were produced by the enzyme reaction with butrylthiocholine (BuTch) or acetylthiocholine (AcTch) substrates, and measured at 412 nm. Dibucaine, a quaternary ammonium compound, inhibited SChE to a minimum within 2 min in a reversible manner. The inhibition was very potent. It had an IC(50) of 5.3 microM with BuTch or 3.8 microM with AcTch. The inhibition was competitive with respect to BuTch with a K(i) of 1.3 microM and a linear-mixed type (competitive/noncompetitive) with respect to AcTch with inhibition constants, K(i) and K(I) of 0.66 and 2.5 microM, respectively. Dibucaine possesses a butoxy side chain that is similar to the butryl group of BuTch and longer by an ethylene group from AcTch. This may account for the difference in inhibition behavior. It may also suggest the existence of an additional binding site, other than the anionic binding site, and of a hydrophobic nature.},

abstract = {Cholinergic transmission at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) has been implicated in higher brain functions such as learning and memory, and loss of synapses may contribute to the symptoms of Alzheimer disease. A heterogeneous family of five genetically distinct mAChR subtypes differentially modulate a variety of intracellular signaling systems as well as the processing of key molecules involved in the pathology of the disease. Although many muscarinic effects have been identified in memory circuits, including a diversity of pre- and post-synaptic actions in hippocampus, the identities of the molecular subtypes responsible for any given function remain elusive. All five mAChR genes are expressed in hippocampus, and subtype-specific antibodies have enabled identification, quantification, and localization of the encoded proteins. The m1, m2, and m4 mAChR proteins are most abundant in forebrain regions and they have distinct cellular and subcellular localizations suggestive of various pre- and postsynaptic functions in cholinergic circuits. The subtypes are also differentially altered in postmortem brain samples from Alzheimer disease cases. Further understanding of the molecular pharmacology of failing synapses in Alzheimer disease, together with the development of new subtype-selective drugs, may provide more specific and effective treatments for the disease.},

abstract = {MicroRNA targets are often recognized through pairing between the miRNA seed region and complementary sites within target mRNAs, but not all of these canonical sites are equally effective, and both computational and in vivo UV-crosslinking approaches suggest that many mRNAs are targeted through non-canonical interactions. Here, we show that recently reported non-canonical sites do not mediate repression despite binding the miRNA, which indicates that the vast majority of functional sites are canonical. Accordingly, we developed an improved quantitative model of canonical targeting, using a compendium of experimental datasets that we pre-processed to minimize confounding biases. This model, which considers site type and another 14 features to predict the most effectively targeted mRNAs, performed significantly better than existing models and was as informative as the best high-throughput in vivo crosslinking approaches. It drives the latest version of TargetScan (v7.0; targetscan.org), thereby providing a valuable resource for placing miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks.},

abstract = {The 22q11.2 deletion is the strongest known genetic risk factor for schizophrenia. Research has implicated microRNA-mediated dysregulation in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) schizophrenia-risk. Primary candidate genes are DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8), which encodes a component of the microprocessor complex essential for microRNA biogenesis, and MIR185, which encodes microRNA 185. Mouse models of 22q11.2DS have demonstrated alterations in brain microRNA biogenesis, and that DGCR8 haploinsufficiency may contribute to these alterations, e.g., via down-regulation of a specific microRNA subset. miR-185 was the top-scoring down-regulated microRNA in both the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, brain areas which are the key foci of schizophrenia research. This reduction in miR-185 expression contributed to dendritic and spine development deficits in hippocampal neurons. In addition, miR-185 has two validated targets (RhoA, Cdc42), both of which have been associated with altered expression levels in schizophrenia. These combined data support the involvement of miR-185 and its down-stream pathways in schizophrenia. This review summarizes evidence implicating microRNA-mediated dysregulation in schizophrenia in both 22q11.2DS-related and idiopathic cases.},

abstract = {Identifying the neuronal cell types that comprise the mammalian forebrain is a central unsolved problem in neuroscience. Global gene expression profiles offer a potentially unbiased way to assess functional relationships between neurons. Here, we carried out microarray analysis of 12 populations of neurons in the adult mouse forebrain. Five of these populations were chosen from cingulate cortex and included several subtypes of GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal neurons. The remaining seven were derived from the somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus. Using these expression profiles, we were able to construct a taxonomic tree that reflected the expected major relationships between these populations, such as the distinction between cortical interneurons and projection neurons. The taxonomic tree indicated highly heterogeneous gene expression even within a single region. This dataset should be useful for the classification of unknown neuronal subtypes, the investigation of specifically expressed genes and the genetic manipulation of specific neuronal circuit elements.},

abstract = {Ischemic stroke accounts for the majority of stroke cases and constitutes a major cause of death and disability in the industrialized world. Inflammation has been reported to constitute a major component of ischemic stroke pathobiology. In the acute phase of ischemic stroke, microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, are activated, followed by several infiltration waves of different circulating immune cells into the brain. Among these circulating immune cells, monocytes have been shown to play a particularly important role. Following their infiltration, monocytes differentiate into potent phagocytic cells, the monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), in the ischemic brain. Initially, the presence of these cells was considered as marker of an exacerbated inflammatory response that contributes to brain damage. However, the recent reports are suggesting a more complex and multiphasic roles of these cells in ischemic stroke pathobiology. Monocytes constitute a heterogeneous group of cells, which comprises two major subsets in rodent and three major subsets in human. In both species, two equivalent subsets exist, the pro-inflammatory subset and the anti-inflammatory subset. Recent data have demonstrated that ischemic stroke differentially regulate monocyte subsets, which directly affect ischemic stroke pathobiology and may have direct implications in ischemic stroke therapies. Here, we review the recent findings that addressed the role of different monocyte subsets in ischemic stroke pathobiology, and the implications on therapies.},

abstract = {Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are integral components of biological networks with fundamental roles in regulating gene expression. They can integrate sequence information from the DNA code, epigenetic regulation and functions of multimeric protein complexes to potentially determine the epigenetic status and transcriptional network in any given cell. Humans potentially contain more ncRNAs than any other species, especially in the brain, where they may well play a significant role in human development and cognitive ability. This review discusses their emerging role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a human pathological condition characterized by the progressive impairment of cognitive functions. We discuss the complexity of the ncRNA world and how this is reflected in the regulation of the amyloid precursor protein and Tau, two proteins with central functions in AD. By understanding this intricate regulatory network, there is hope for a better understanding of disease mechanisms and ultimately developing diagnostic and therapeutic tools.},

abstract = {Interneurons immunoreactive for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are integral elements of columnar organization patterns in the rat cerebral cortex. By application of the sensitive mirror technique, the co-localization of VIP with the classical inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), was investigated in neocortical neurons. Furthermore, the frequency of co-localization of ChAT with GABA was determined. In a sample of 118 VIP-immunoreactive neurons, mostly from the primary somatosensory cortex, it was demonstrated that virtually all of them reveal immunoreactivity for GABA and, therefore, are to be GABAergic. Moreover, 34{\%} of mostly bipolar, VIP-positive neurons contained ChAT and are, thus, supposedly cholinergic as well. Co-localization of VIP and ChAT varied according to cortical laminae. Finally, 88{\%} of a total of 60 ChAT-immunoreactive neurons were also immunostained for GABA. It is concluded that almost all VIP-immunoreactive neurons and most of the cholinergic neurons in rat neocortex represent partly overlapping subpopulations of inhibitory interneurons utilizing GABA.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive malignant tumor involving glial cells in the human brain. We used high-throughput sequencing to comprehensively profile the small RNAs expressed in glioblastoma and non-tumor brain tissues. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) made up the large majority of small RNAs, and we identified over 400 different cellular pre-miRNAs. No known viral miRNAs were detected in any of the samples analyzed. Cluster analysis revealed several miRNAs that were significantly down-regulated in glioblastomas, including miR-128, miR-124, miR-7, miR-139, miR-95, and miR-873. Post-transcriptional editing was observed for several miRNAs, including the miR-376 family, miR-411, miR-381, and miR-379. Using the deep sequencing information, we designed a lentiviral vector expressing a cell suicide gene, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene, under the regulation of a miRNA, miR-128, that was found to be enriched in non-tumor brain tissue yet down-regulated in glioblastomas, Glioblastoma cells transduced with this vector were selectively killed when cultured in the presence of ganciclovir. Using an in vitro model to recapitulate expression of brain-enriched miRNAs, we demonstrated that neuronally differentiated SH-SY5Y cells transduced with the miRNA-regulated HSV-TK vector are protected from killing by expression of endogenous miR-128. Together, these results provide an in-depth analysis of miRNA dysregulation in glioblastoma and demonstrate the potential utility of these data in the design of miRNA-regulated therapies for the treatment of brain cancers.},

abstract = {Noncoding regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) of cellular and viral origin control gene expression by repressing the translation of mRNAs into protein. Interestingly, miRNAs are secreted actively through small vesicles called "exosomes" that protect them from degradation by RNases, suggesting that these miRNAs may function outside the cell in which they were produced. Here we demonstrate that miRNAs secreted by EBV-infected cells are transferred to and act in uninfected recipient cells. Using a quantitative RT-PCR approach, we demonstrate that mature EBV-encoded miRNAs are secreted by EBV-infected B cells through exosomes. These EBV-miRNAs are functional because internalization of exosomes by MoDC results in a dose-dependent, miRNA-mediated repression of confirmed EBV target genes, including CXCL11/ITAC, an immunoregulatory gene down-regulated in primary EBV-associated lymphomas. We demonstrate that throughout coculture of EBV-infected B cells EBV-miRNAs accumulate in noninfected neighboring MoDC and show that this accumulation is mediated by transfer of exosomes. Thus, the exogenous EBV-miRNAs transferred through exosomes are delivered to subcellular sites of gene repression in recipient cells. Finally, we show in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with increased EBV load that, although EBV DNA is restricted to the circulating B-cell population, EBV BART miRNAs are present in both B-cell and non-B-cell fractions, suggestive of miRNA transfer. Taken together our findings are consistent with miRNA-mediated gene silencing as a potential mechanism of intercellular communication between cells of the immune system that may be exploited by the persistent human gamma-herpesvirus EBV.},

abstract = {Humans can see and name thousands of distinct object and action categories, so it is unlikely that each category is represented in a distinct brain area. A more efficient scheme would be to represent categories as locations in a continuous semantic space mapped smoothly across the cortical surface. To search for such a space, we used fMRI to measure human brain activity evoked by natural movies. We then used voxelwise models to examine the cortical representation of 1,705 object and action categories. The first few dimensions of the underlying semantic space were recovered from the fit models by principal components analysis. Projection of the recovered semantic space onto cortical flat maps shows that semantic selectivity is organized into smooth gradients that cover much of visual and nonvisual cortex. Furthermore, both the recovered semantic space and the cortical organization of the space are shared across different individuals. VIDEO ABSTRACT:},

abstract = {RNA binding proteins (RBPs) orchestrate the production, processing, and function of mRNAs. Here, we present the affinity landscapes of 78 human RBPs using an unbiased assay that determines the sequence, structure, and context preferences of these proteins in vitro by deep sequencing of bound RNAs. These data enable construction of “RNA maps” of RBP activity without requiring crosslinking-based assays. We found an unexpectedly low diversity of RNA motifs, implying frequent convergence of binding specificity toward a relatively small set of RNA motifs, many with low compositional complexity. Offsetting this trend, however, we observed extensive preferences for contextual features distinct from short linear RNA motifs, including spaced “bipartite” motifs, biased flanking nucleotide composition, and bias away from or toward RNA structure. Our results emphasize the importance of contextual features in RNA recognition, which likely enable targeting of distinct subsets of transcripts by different RBPs that recognize the same linear motif. Dominguez et al. describe in vitro binding specificities of 78 human RNA binding proteins (RBPs) to RNA sequences and structures. They find that many RBPs bind similar RNA motifs but differ in affinity for spaced “bipartite” motifs, flanking composition, and RNA structure, supporting the model that distinct motif occurrences are often discriminated based on sequence context.},

abstract = {A minimally invasive diagnostic assay for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is required to select optimal patient groups in clinical trials, monitor disease progression and response to treatment, and to better plan patient clinical care. Blood is an attractive source for biomarkers due to minimal discomfort to the patient, encouraging greater compliance in clinical trials and frequent testing. MiRNAs belong to the class of non-coding regulatory RNA molecules of ∼22 nt length and are now recognized to regulate ∼60{\%} of all known genes through post-transcriptional gene silencing (RNAi). They have potential as useful biomarkers for clinical use because of their stability and ease of detection in many tissues, especially blood. Circulating profiles of miRNAs have been shown to discriminate different tumor types, indicate staging and progression of the disease and to be useful as prognostic markers. Recently their role in neurodegenerative diseases, both as diagnostic biomarkers as well as explaining basic disease etiology has come into focus. Here we report the discovery and validation of a unique circulating 7-miRNA signature (hsa-let-7d-5p, hsa-let-7g-5p, hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-142-3p, hsa-miR-191-5p, hsa-miR-301a-3p and hsa-miR-545-3p) in plasma, which could distinguish AD patients from normal controls (NC) with {\textgreater}95{\%} accuracy (AUC of 0.953). There was a {\textgreater}2 fold difference for all signature miRNAs between the AD and NC samples, with p-values{\textless}0.05. Pathway analysis, taking into account enriched target mRNAs for these signature miRNAs was also carried out, suggesting that the disturbance of multiple enzymatic pathways including lipid metabolism could play a role in AD etiology.},

abstract = {Lifestyle factors emerge as key modifiers of the risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent senile dementia. Stress accelerates, whereas positive lifestyle factors such as physical and mental exercise, slow the progression of AD symptoms and neuropathological hallmarks in humans and genetic mouse models of the condition. Positive lifestyle factors are thought to improve brain function and delay ageing through the induction of a mild stress response as opposed to excessive stress reactions causing the harmful effects of adverse stressors. This suggests that stress mediators can be targeted for the development of improved treatment for AD. This review discussed the involvement of glucocorticoids, corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and cholinergic stress reactions, through the induction of a protective splice variant of synaptic acetylcholinesterase (AChE-R), in the progression of AD symptoms and neuropathological hallmarks and the impact of lifestyle factors. It is concluded that CRH is likely to play a critical, dose-dependent role in AD progression, protective at low doses but harmful at high doses, whereas an excess of glucocorticoids may only exacerbate some aspects of the disease. AChE-R shows a promising therapeutic potential which needs to be further investigated.},

abstract = {The longevity of an organism depends on the health of its cells. Throughout life cells are exposed to numerous intrinsic and extrinsic stresses, such as free radicals, generated through mitochondrial electron transport, and ultraviolet irradiation. The cell has evolved numerous mechanisms to scavenge free radicals and repair damage induced by these insults. One mechanism employed by the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae to combat stress utilizes the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC), an essential multi-subunit ubiquitin-protein ligase structurally and functionally conserved from yeast to humans that controls progression through mitosis and G1. We have observed that yeast cells expressing compromised APC subunits are sensitive to multiple stresses and have shorter replicative and chronological lifespans. In a pathway that runs parallel to that regulated by the APC, members of the Forkhead box (Fox) transcription factor family also regulate stress responses. The yeast Fox orthologs Fkh1 and Fkh2 appear to drive the transcription of stress response factors and slow early G1 progression, while the APC seems to regulate chromatin structure, chromosome segregation, and resetting of the transcriptome in early G1. In contrast, under non-stress conditions, the Fkhs play a complex role in cell-cycle progression, partially through activation of the APC. Direct and indirect interactions between the APC and the yeast Fkhs appear to be pivotal for lifespan determination. Here we explore the potential for these interactions to be evolutionarily conserved as a mechanism to balance cell-cycle regulation with stress responses.},

abstract = {Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play increasingly appreciated gene-regulatory roles. Here, we describe a regulatory network centered on four ncRNAs—a long ncRNA, a circular RNA, and two microRNAs—using gene editing in mice to probe the molecular consequences of disrupting key components of this network. The long ncRNA Cyrano uses an extensively paired site to miR-7 to trigger destruction of this microRNA. Cyrano-directed miR-7 degradation is much more effective than previously described examples of target-directed microRNA degradation, which come primarily from studies of artificial and viral RNAs. By reducing miR-7 levels, Cyrano prevents repression of miR-7–targeted mRNAs and enables accumulation of Cdr1as, a circular RNA known to regulate neuronal activity. Without Cyrano, excess miR-7 causes cytoplasmic destruction of Cdr1as in neurons, in part through enhanced slicing of Cdr1as by a second miRNA, miR-671. Thus, several types of ncRNAs can collaborate to establish a sophisticated regulatory network. Three different classes of noncoding RNA converge in a regulatory network whereby a long noncoding RNA represses a microRNA via target-directed microRNA degradation, which in turn enables the accumulation of a circular RNA in the mouse brain.},

abstract = {During the last two decades, microRNAs (miRNAs) emerged as critical regulators of gene expression. By modulating the expression of numerous target mRNAs mainly at the post-transcriptional level, these small non-coding RNAs have been involved in most, if not all, biological processes as well as in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. miR-132 and miR-212 are tandem miRNAs whose expression is necessary for the proper development, maturation and function of neurons and whose deregulation is associated with several neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and tauopathies (neurodegenerative diseases resulting from the pathological aggregation of tau protein in the human brain). Although their involvement in neuronal functions is the most described, evidences point towards a role of these miRNAs in many other biological processes, including inflammation and immune functions. Incidentally, miR-132 was recently classified as a 'neurimmiR', a class of miRNAs operating within and between the neural and immune compartments. In this review, we propose an outline of the current knowledge about miR-132 and miR-212 functions in neurons and immune cells, by describing the signalling pathways and transcription factors regulating their expression as well as their putative or demonstrated roles and validated mRNA targets.},

The elevations in mature miRNAs were however not detected before 2 h later, suggesting a slower processing of the precursors into mature miRNAs.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common causes of mental deterioration in elderly people, accounting for around 50{\%}-60{\%} of the overall cases of dementia among persons over 65 years of age. The past two decades have witnessed a considerable research effort directed towards discovering the cause of Alzheimer's disease with the ultimate hope of developing safe and effective pharmacological treatments. This article examines the existing scientific applicability of the original cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease by describing the biochemical and histopathological changes of neurotransmitter markers that occur in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease both at postmortem and neurosurgical cerebral biopsy and the behavioural consequences of cholinomimetic drugs and cholinergic lesions. Such studies have resulted in the discovery of an association between a decline in learning and memory, and a deficit in excitatory amino acid (EAA) neurotransmission, together with important roles for the cholinergic system in attentional processing and as a modulator of EAA neurotransmission. Accordingly, although there is presently no "cure" for Alzheimer's disease, a large number of potential therapeutic interventions have emerged that are designed to correct loss of presynaptic cholinergic function. A few of these compounds have confirmed efficacy in delaying the deterioration of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, a valuable treatment target considering the progressive nature of the disease. Indeed, three compounds have received European approval for the treatment of the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, first tacrine and more recently, donepezil and rivastigmine, all of which are cholinesterase inhibitors.},

abstract = {Toxicity of organophosphorus insecticides is mainly due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, but, oxidative stress may be involved in the toxicity of this pesticides. Therefore, it was investigated whether diazinon, a commonly used organophosphate, may induce oxidative stress and cholinesterase inhibition in different tissues of Cyprinus carpio. Sublethal concentrations of diazinon (0.0036, 0.018 and 0.036ppb) were administired to C. carpio L. for 5, 15 and 30 days. The study was made by measuring biochemical stress responses of C. carpio L. spectrophotometrically taking into account acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Na(+)K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+)K(+)-ATPase) and other antioxidant enzyme activities, as well as malondialdehyde and protein contents in gill, muscle and kidney tissues of the fish. Results of the study suggest that AChE (in gill and muscle tissues) and Na(+)K(+)-ATPase (in muscle and kidney tissues) activities decreased; that antioxidant enzymes, in particular superoxide dismutase (SOD), increased in gill, kidney and muscle tissues. We also observed the existence of a protective function of antioxidant enzymes against lipid peroxidation in muscle tissue. The changes in MDA content varied between increases and decreases in kidney tissue. In gill tissue, however, lipid peroxidation could not be prevented despite induction of SOD and glutathione peroxidase activities. We could see that the protein content decreased only in gill tissue as diazinon dosage was gradually increased until the 15th day of the experiment. During the period between 15th and the 30th days, the protein level in the fish was observed to have reached to that of the control group. This change in protein level can be attributed to adjustment of the fish to its new environmental conditions. Considering most of the parameters in tissues, it can be stated that diazinon exerted its effect at low concentration and during a long period of time, and its toxicity increased dose dependently. This study reveals that C. carpio developed tissue-specific adaptive response to neutralize the oxidative stress following pesticide exposure depending on different antioxidant levels in tissues and that SOD can be used as a biomarker in determining diazinon toxicity due to its early response at even low concentration levels.},

Given the limited accuracy of current AD clinical diagnosis, biomarkers of AD pathologies are currently being sought. Reductions in cerebrospinal fluid levels of $\beta$-amyloid 42 (a marker of amyloid plaques) and elevations in tau species (markers of neurofibrillary tangles and/or neurodegeneration) are well-established as biomarkers useful for AD diagnosis and prognosis. However, novel markers for other features of AD pathophysiology (e.g., $\beta$-amyloid processing, neuroinflammation and neuronal stress/dysfunction) and for other non-AD dementias are required to improve the accuracy of AD disease diagnosis, prognosis, staging and therapeutic monitoring (theragnosis). This article discusses the potential of several promising novel cerebrospinal fluid analytes, highlights the next steps critical for advancement in the field, and provides a prediction on how the field may evolve in 510 years.},

New approaches (DNA vaccines, new combination vaccines, new formulations, novel delivery routes, new adjuvants) are being vigorously explored. New needs (defence vaccines) are being identified. One common element in all these varied areas is that pre-clinical evaluation of a candidate new vaccine is a pre-requisite before initiation of clinical trials in humans. Laboratory evaluation also usually continues during the clinical phase of vaccine development. Pre-clinical and laboratory evaluations often involve animals. Data from these studies are used to support an application for marketing authorisation. Regulatory Authorities use precedent to help assess these applications. Where no precedent exists the Regulatory Authorities apply risk-benefit analyses based on the perceived risks of a new product or process. These perceived risks are constantly reviewed as experience is gained. The World Health Organisation facilitates the development of scientific consensus on issues that have an impact on the quality and safety of biological medicines, including vaccines. New vaccine technologies often present new challenges for the safety and efficacy evaluation of candidate preparations. Animal models are usually very important in this process. The number of new vaccine candidates seems set to increase in the short-term.},

abstract = {Herein, we report the first evidence that c-SRC is required for retinoic acid (RA) receptor (RAR) signaling, an observation that suggests a new paradigm for this family of nuclear hormone receptors. We observed that CSK negatively regulates RAR functions required for neuritogenic differentiation. CSK overexpression inhibited RA-mediated neurite outgrowth, a result which correlated with the inhibition of the SFK c-SRC. Consistent with an extranuclear effect of CSK on RAR signaling and neurite outgrowth, CSK overexpression blocked the downstream activation of RAC1. The conversion of GDP-RAC1 to GTP-RAC1 parallels the activation of c-SRC as early as 15 min following all-trans-retinoic acid treatment in LA-N-5 cells. The cytoplasmic colocalization of c-SRC and RARgamma was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. A direct and ligand-dependent binding of RAR with SRC was observed by surface plasmon resonance, and coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed the in vivo binding of RARgamma to c-SRC. Deletion of a proline-rich domain within RARgamma abrogated this interaction in vivo. CSK blocked the RAR-RA-dependent activation of SRC and neurite outgrowth in LA-N-5 cells. The results suggest that transcriptional signaling events mediated by RA-RAR are necessary but not sufficient to mediate complex differentiation in neuronal cells. We have elucidated a nongenomic extranuclear signal mediated by the RAR-SRC interaction that is negatively regulated by CSK and is required for RA-induced neuronal differentiation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cholinergic neurotransmission notably participates in stress-induced motor responses. Here we report the contribution of alternative splicing of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) pre-mRNA to modulate these responses. More specifically, we induced stress-associated hypofunction of dopaminergic, mainly D2 dopamine receptor-mediated neurotransmission by haloperidol and explored stress induced hyperlocomotion and catalepsy, an extreme form of immobility, induced in mice with AChE deficiencies. METHODS: Conditional transgenic (Tet/AS) mice were created with tetracycline-induced antisense suppression of AChE gene expression. Locomotion and catalepsy times were measured in Tet/AS and strain-matched control mice, under open-field exposure threat and under home-cage safety. RESULTS: In vitro, NGF-treated PC12 cells failed to extend neurites upon Tet/AS suppression. In vivo, Tet/AS but not control mice showed stress-associated hippocampal deposits of heat-shock protein 70 and GRP78 (BiP), predicting posttranscriptional changes in neuronal reactions. Supporting this notion, their striatal cholinergic neurons demonstrated facilitated capacity for neurite extension, attributing these in vivo changes in neurite extension to network interactions. Tet/AS mice presented stress-induced hyperlocomotion. Moreover, the dopamine antagonist haloperidol induced longer catalepsy in threatened Tet/AS than in control mice. When returned to home-cage safety, Tet/AS mice showed retarded release from catalepsy.

abstract = {Genomes of complex organisms encode an abundance and diversity of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are expressed throughout the cell and fulfill a wide variety of regulatory roles at almost every stage of gene expression. These roles, which encompass sensory, guiding, scaffolding and allosteric capacities, derive from folded modular domains in lncRNAs. In this diverse functional repertoire, we focus on the well-characterized ability for lncRNAs to function as epigenetic modulators. Many lncRNAs bind to chromatin-modifying proteins and recruit their catalytic activity to specific sites in the genome, thereby modulating chromatin states and impacting gene expression. Considering this regulatory potential in combination with the abundance of lncRNAs suggests that lncRNAs may be part of a broad epigenetic regulatory network.},

abstract = {RNA-Seq is currently used routinely, and it provides accurate information on gene transcription. However, the method cannot accurately estimate duplicated genes expression. Several strategies have been previously used (drop duplicated genes, distribute uniformly the reads, or estimate expression), but all of them provide biased results. We provide here a tool, called mmquant, for computing gene expression, included duplicated genes. If a read maps at different positions, the tool detects that the corresponding genes are duplicated; it merges the genes and creates a merged gene. The counts of ambiguous reads is then based on the input genes and the merged genes. mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way.},

abstract = {Proteomic analyses of cartilage and, to a lesser extent, of bone have long been impaired because of technical challenges related to their structure and biochemical properties. We have developed a unified method based on phenol extraction, 2DE, silver staining, and subsequent LC-MS/MS. This method proved to be efficient to characterize the proteome of equine cartilage and bone samples collected in vivo. Since proteins from several cellular compartments could be recovered, our procedure is mainly suitable for in situ molecular physiology studies focused on the cellular content of chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts as well as that of the extracellular matrix, with the exception of proteoglycans. Our method alleviates some drawbacks of cell culture that can mask physiological differences, as well as reduced reproducibility due to fractionation. Proteomic comparative studies between cartilage and bone samples from healthy and affected animals were thus achieved successfully. This achievement will contribute to increasing knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiopathology of numerous osteoarticular diseases in horses and in humans.},

abstract = {SUMMARY We created a deeply extracted and annotated database of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) results. GRASP v1.0 contains {\textgreater}6.2 million SNP-phenotype association from among 1390 GWAS studies. We re-annotated GWAS results with 16 annotation sources including some rarely compared to GWAS results (e.g. RNAediting sites, lincRNAs, PTMs). MOTIVATION To create a high-quality resource to facilitate further use and interpretation of human GWAS results in order to address important scientific questions. RESULTS GWAS have grown exponentially, with increases in sample sizes and markers tested, and continuing bias toward European ancestry samples. GRASP contains {\textgreater}100 000 phenotypes, roughly: eQTLs (71.5{\%}), metabolite QTLs (21.2{\%}), methylation QTLs (4.4{\%}) and diseases, biomarkers and other traits (2.8{\%}). cis-eQTLs, meQTLs, mQTLs and MHC region SNPs are highly enriched among significant results. After removing these categories, GRASP still contains a greater proportion of studies and results than comparable GWAS catalogs. Cardiovascular disease and related risk factors pre-dominate remaining GWAS results, followed by immunological, neurological and cancer traits. Significant results in GWAS display a highly gene-centric tendency. Sex chromosome X (OR = 0.18[0.16-0.20]) and Y (OR = 0.003[0.001-0.01]) genes are depleted for GWAS results. Gene length is correlated with GWAS results at nominal significance (P ≤ 0.05) levels. We show this gene-length correlation decays at increasingly more stringent P-value thresholds. Potential pleotropic genes and SNPs enriched for multi-phenotype association in GWAS are identified. However, we note possible population stratification at some of these loci. Finally, via re-annotation we identify compelling functional hypotheses at GWAS loci, in some cases unrealized in studies to date. CONCLUSION Pooling summary-level GWAS results and re-annotating with bioinformatics predictions and molecular features provides a good platform for new insights. AVAILABILITY The GRASP database is available at http://apps.nhlbi.nih.gov/grasp.},

abstract = {Synaptic activity is a spatially limited process that requires a precise, yet dynamic, complement of proteins within the synaptic micro-domain. The maintenance and regulation of these synaptic proteins is regulated, in part, by local mRNA translation in dendrites. Protein synthesis within the postsynaptic compartment allows neurons tight spatial and temporal control of synaptic protein expression, which is critical for proper functioning of synapses and neural circuits. In this review, we discuss the identity of proteins synthesized within dendrites, the receptor-mediated mechanisms regulating their synthesis, and the possible roles for these locally synthesized proteins. We also explore how our current understanding of dendritic protein synthesis in the hippocampus can be applied to new brain regions and to understanding the pathological mechanisms underlying varied neurological diseases.},

abstract = {The identification of reliable biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains challenging. Recently, abnormal levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-27a, miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-125b in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients were reported. We aimed to confirm the biomarker potential of these miRNAs for AD diagnosis. Additionally, we examined the influence of blood contamination on CSF miRNA levels as potential confounding factor. We studied expression levels of the four miRNAs by quantitative PCR in CSF samples of AD patients and non-demented controls, and in blood-spiked CSF. Levels of miR-29a, but not of the other three miRNAs, were increased by a factor of 2.2 in CSF of AD patients. Spiking of small amounts of blood into CSF revealed that miR-27a and miR-29a, but not miR-125b levels were strongly influenced by the number of blood cells in the sample. In conclusion, miR-29a may be a candidate biomarker for AD, but only when used in cell-free CSF.},

abstract = {Overview-One hundred and ten years since its first description Alzheimer's disease (AD) still retains its prominent status: (i) as the industrialized world's number one cause of age-related intellectual impairment and cognitive decline; (ii) as this country's most rapidly expanding socioeconomic and healthcare concern; and (iii) as an insidious, progressive and lethal neurological disorder of the human central nervous system (CNS) for which there is currently no adequate treatment or cure (Alzheimer, 1991; Alzheimer et al., 1991, 1995) [https://www.alz.org/facts/downloads/facts{\_}figures{\_}2015.pdf (2015)]. The concept of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) as being involved in the etiopathogenesis of AD and age-related human neurodegenerative disease was first proposed about 25 years ago, however it was not until 2007 that specific microRNA (miRNA) abundance, speciation and localization to the hippocampal CA1 region (an anatomical area of the human CNS specifically targeted by the AD process) was shown to strongly associate with AD-type change when compared to age-matched controls (Lukiw et al., 1992; Lukiw, 2007; Schipper et al., 2007; Cogswell et al., 2008; Guerreiro et al., 2012). Currently about 400 reports address the potential link between disruptions in miRNA signaling and the development of various features associated with AD neuropathology (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=micro+RNA+alzheimer's+disease). In this " Perspectives " paper we will highlight some of the most recent literature on anti-miRNA (AM; antagomir) therapeutic strategies and some very recent technological advances in the analysis and characterization of defective miRNA signaling pathways in AD compared to neurologically normal age-matched controls.},

abstract = {SignificanceThe brain comprises an immense number of cells and cellular connections. We describe the first, to our knowledge, single cell whole transcriptome analysis of human adult cortical samples. We have established an experimental and analytical framework with which the complexity of the human brain can be dissected on the single cell level. Using this approach, we were able to identify all major cell types of the brain and characterize subtypes of neuronal cells. We observed changes in neurons from early developmental to late differentiated stages in the adult. We found a subset of adult neurons which express major histocompatibility complex class I genes and thus are not immune privileged. The human brain is a tissue of vast complexity in terms of the cell types it comprises. Conventional approaches to classifying cell types in the human brain at single cell resolution have been limited to exploring relatively few markers and therefore have provided a limited molecular characterization of any given cell type. We used single cell RNA sequencing on 466 cells to capture the cellular complexity of the adult and fetal human brain at a whole transcriptome level. Healthy adult temporal lobe tissue was obtained during surgical procedures where otherwise normal tissue was removed to gain access to deeper hippocampal pathology in patients with medical refractory seizures. We were able to classify individual cells into all of the major neuronal, glial, and vascular cell types in the brain. We were able to divide neurons into individual communities and show that these communities preserve the categorization of interneuron subtypes that is typically observed with the use of classic interneuron markers. We then used single cell RNA sequencing on fetal human cortical neurons to identify genes that are differentially expressed between fetal and adult neurons and those genes that display an expression gradient that reflects the transition between replicating and quiescent fetal neuronal populations. Finally, we observed the expression of major histocompatibility complex type I genes in a subset of adult neurons, but not fetal neurons. The work presented here demonstrates the applicability of single cell RNA sequencing on the study of the adult human brain and constitutes a first step toward a comprehensive cellular atlas of the human brain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to assess if cytokines levels (IL-6 and IL-10) are related to major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), in a population-based study. 

METHODS
This was a cross-sectional study population-based, involving 1037 people aged 18–35. MDD, BD, anxiety and suicide risk were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Serum IL-6 and IL-10 were measured by ELISA using a commercial kit. 

RESULTS
The total sample comprised 1034 young adults, being 14.4{\%} with MDD and 13.7{\%} with BD. MDD and BD groups showed significantly higher serum IL-6 levels (p ≤ 0.001) and IL-10 levels (p ≤ 0.001) when compared to healthy control group. No correlation was found between serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels in health control group (p = 0.830; r = −0.008), non-suicide risk (p = 0.337; r = 0.032) and non-anxiety disorder (p = 0.375; r = 0.031). Covariance analysis showed that mood disorders alone, increase both interleukin levels (IL-6, p = 0.019; and IL-10, p = 0.026), whilst the interaction of mood disorders and suicide risk or anxiety disorders did not. 

CONCLUSION
Our results suggest that inflammatory dysregulation may be involved in the physiopathology of mood disorders and serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels are putative biomarkers for these disorders.},

abstract = {Results from clinical and imaging studies provide evidence for changes in schizophrenia with disease progression, however, the underlying molecular differences that may occur at different stages of illness have not been investigated. To test the hypothesis that the molecular basis for schizophrenia changes from early to chronic illness, we profiled genome-wide expression patterns in prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic subjects at different stages of illness, along with their age- and sex-matched controls. Results show that gene expression profiles change dramatically depending on the stage of illness, whereby the greatest number and magnitude of gene expression differences were detected in subjects with short-term illness ({\textless}or=4 years from diagnosis). Comprehensive pathways analyses revealed that each defined stage of illness was associated with dysfunction in both distinct, as well as overlapping systems. Short-term illness was particularly associated with disruptions in gene transcription, metal ion binding, RNA processing and vesicle-mediated transport. In contrast, long-term illness was associated with inflammation, stimulus-response and immune functions. We validated expression differences of 12 transcripts associated with these various functions by real-time PCR analysis. While only four genes, SAMSN1, CDC42BPB, DSC2 and PTPRE, were consistently expressed across all groups, there was dysfunction in overlapping systems among all stages, including cellular signal transduction, lipid metabolism and protein localization. Our results demonstrate that the molecular basis for schizophrenia changes from early to chronic stages, providing evidence for a changing nature of schizophrenia with disease progression.},

abstract = {The problem of identifying subtle time-space clustering of dis ease, as may be occurring in leukemia, is described and reviewed. Published approaches, generally associated with studies of leuke mia, not dependent on knowledge of the underlying population for their validity, are directed towards identifying clustering by establishing a relationship between the temporal and the spatial separations for the n(n - 1)/2 possible pairs which can be formed from the n observed cases of disease. Here it is proposed that statistical power can be improved by applying a reciprocal trans form to these separations. While a permutational approach can give valid probability levels for any observed association, for reasons of practicability, it is suggested that the observed associa tion be tested relative to its permutational variance. Formulas and computational procedures for doing so are given. While the distance measures between points represent sym metric relationships subject to mathematical and geometric regu larities, the variance formula developed is appropriate for ar bitrary relationships. Simplified procedures are given for the ease of symmetric and skew-symmetric relationships. The general pro cedure is indicated as being potentially useful in other situations as, for example, the study of interpersonal relationships. Viewing the procedure as a regression approach, the possibility for extend ing it to nonlinear and multivariate situations is suggested. Other aspects of the problem and of the procedure developed are discussed.},

abstract = {Atypical food intake is a primary cause of obesity and other eating and metabolic disorders. Insight into the neural control of feeding has previously focused mainly on signalling mechanisms associated with the hypothalamus, the major centre in the brain that regulates body weight homeostasis. However, roles of non-canonical central nervous system signalling mechanisms in regulating feeding behaviour have been largely uncharacterized. Acetylcholine has long been proposed to influence feeding owing in part to the functional similarity between acetylcholine and nicotine, a known appetite suppressant. Nicotine is an exogenous agonist for acetylcholine receptors, suggesting that endogenous cholinergic signalling may play a part in normal physiological regulation of feeding. However, it remains unclear how cholinergic neurons in the brain regulate food intake. Here we report that cholinergic neurons of the mouse basal forebrain potently influence food intake and body weight. Impairment of cholinergic signalling increases food intake and results in severe obesity, whereas enhanced cholinergic signalling decreases food consumption. We found that cholinergic circuits modulate appetite suppression on downstream targets in the hypothalamus. Together our data reveal the cholinergic basal forebrain as a major modulatory centre underlying feeding behaviour.},

The BeadArray technology from Illumina makes its preprocessing and quality control different from other microarray technologies.

It includes data input, quality control, variance stabilization, normalization and gene annotation portions. In specific, the lumi package includes a variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) algorithm that takes advantage of the technical replicates available on every Illumina microarray. Different normalization method options and multiple quality control plots are provided in the package. To better annotate the Illumina data, a vendor independent nucleotide universal identifier (nuID) was devised to identify the probes of Illumina microarray. The nuID annotation packages and output of lumi processed results can be easily integrated with other Bioconductor packages to construct a statistical data analysis pipeline for Illumina data.

Hematopoietic cell fractions positive for the myeloproliferative acetylcholinesterase-R variant, were similarly high in post-partum blood, both intracellular and on the cell surface. Moreover, intracellular acetylcholinesterase-S protein amounts as reflected by fluorescence intensity measurements remained unchanged in myeloid cells from post-partum mothers as compared with matched controls. Unlike brain neurons, which over-express intracellular acetylcholinesterase-R under stress, lymphocytes from post-partum mothers presented increased surface acetylcholinesterase-S and pronounced decreases in both the expression and contents of surface acetylcholinesterase-R.

abstract = {Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a potent neuroprotective cytokine in different animal models of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, although its action mechanisms are still poorly characterized. We tested the hypothesis that an increased function of glial glutamate transporters (GTs) could underlie CNTF-mediated neuroprotection. We show that neuronal loss induced by in vivo striatal injection of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA) was significantly reduced (by approximately 75{\%}) in CNTF-treated animals. In striatal slices, acute QA application dramatically inhibited corticostriatal field potentials (FPs), whose recovery was significantly higher in CNTF rats compared to controls (approximately 40{\%} vs. approximately 7{\%}), confirming an enhanced resistance to excitotoxicity. The GT inhibitor DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate greatly reduced FP recovery in CNTF rats, supporting the role of GT in CNTF-mediated neuroprotection. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from striatal medium spiny neurons showed no alteration of basic properties of striatal glutamatergic transmission in CNTF animals, but the increased effect of a low-affinity competitive glutamate receptor antagonist (gamma-D-glutamylglycine) also suggested an enhanced GT function. These data strongly support our hypothesis that CNTF is neuroprotective via an increased function of glial GTs, and further confirms the therapeutic potential of CNTF for the clinical treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases involving glutamate overflow.},

Most of these studies have focused on protein-coding genes residing in the CNVs. Here, we investigated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) within 10 SCZ risk–associated CNV deletion regions (CNV-lncRNAs) and examined their potential contribution to SCZ risk. We used RNA sequencing transcriptome data derived from postmortem brain tissue from control individuals without psychiatric disease as part of the PsychENCODE BrainGVEX and Developmental Capstone projects. We carried out weighted gene coexpression network analysis to identify protein-coding genes coexpressed with CNV-lncRNAs in the human brain. We identified one neuronal function–related coexpression module shared by both datasets. This module contained a lncRNA called DGCR5 within the 22q11.2 CNV region, which was identified as a hub gene. Protein-coding genes associated with SCZ genome-wide association study signals, de novo mutations, or differential expression were also contained in this neuronal module. Using DGCR5 knockdown and overexpression experiments in human neural progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, we identified a potential role for DGCR5 in regulating certain SCZ-related genes. },

abstract = {Cadherins play a key role in the dynamics of cell-cell contact formation and remodeling of junctions and tissues. Cadherin-cadherin interactions are gated by extracellular Ca(2+), which serves to rigidify the cadherin extracellular domains and promote trans junctional interactions. Here we describe the direct visualization and quantification of spatiotemporal dynamics of N-cadherin interactions across intercellular junctions in living cells using a genetically encodable FRET reporter system. Direct measurements of transjunctional cadherin interactions revealed a sudden, but partial, loss of homophilic interactions ($\tau$ = 1.17 0.06 s(-1)) upon chelation of extracellular Ca(2+). A cadherin mutant with reduced adhesive activity (W2A) exhibited a faster, more substantial loss of homophilic interactions ($\tau$ = 0.86 0.02 s(-1)), suggesting two types of native cadherin interactions-one that is rapidly modulated by changes in extracellular Ca(2+) and another with relatively stable adhesive activity that is Ca(2+) independent. The Ca(2+)-sensitive dynamics of cadherin interactions were transmitted to the cell interior where $\beta$-catenin translocated to N-cadherin at the junction in both cells. These data indicate that cadherins can rapidly convey dynamic information about the extracellular environment to both cells that comprise a junction.},

abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) ({\textgreater} 200 bp) play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation during numerous biological processes. However, it is challenging to comprehensively identify lncRNAs, because they are often expressed at low levels and with more cell-type specificity than are protein-coding genes. In the present study, we performed ab initio transcriptome reconstruction using eight purified cell populations from mouse cortex and detected more than 5000 lncRNAs. Predicting the functions of lncRNAs using cell-type specific data revealed their potential functional roles in Central Nervous System (CNS) development. We performed motif searches in ENCODE DNase I digital footprint data and Mouse ENCODE promoters to infer transcription factor (TF) occupancy. By integrating TF binding and cell-type specific transcriptomic data, we constructed a novel framework that is useful for systematically identifying lncRNAs that are potentially essential for brain cell fate determination. Based on this integrative analysis, we identified lncRNAs that are regulated during Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell (OPC) differentiation from Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) and that are likely to be involved in oligodendrogenesis. The top candidate, lnc-OPC, shows highly specific expression in OPCs and remarkable sequence conservation among placental mammals. Interestingly, lnc-OPC is significantly up-regulated in glial progenitors from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse models compared to wild-type mice. OLIG2-binding sites in the upstream regulatory region of lnc-OPC were identified by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-Sequencing and validated by luciferase assays. Loss-of-function experiments confirmed that lnc-OPC plays a functional role in OPC genesis. Overall, our results substantiated the role of lncRNA in OPC fate determination and provided an unprecedented data source for future functional investigations in CNS cell types. We present our datasets and analysis results via the interactive genome browser at our laboratory website that is freely accessible to the research community. This is the first lncRNA expression database of collective populations of glia, vascular cells, and neurons. We anticipate that these studies will advance the knowledge of this major class of non-coding genes and their potential roles in neurological development and diseases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To observe patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with the interleukin-6 receptor-alpha inhibitor tocilizumab (TCZ) in routine clinical practice. METHODS Data on concomitant medications, effectiveness and safety were pooled from independent, multinational studies in patients with RA initiating intravenous TCZ according to local label recommendations observed in routine practice for 6 months. Patients were grouped by TCZ monotherapy or combination therapy with conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients receiving TCZ after 6 months. RESULTS Of 1336 patients enrolled, 506 (37.9{\%}) received TCZ monotherapy and 830 (62.1{\%}) received combination therapy. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated that 80{\%} (95{\%} CI, 76{\%}-83{\%}) of monotherapy and 87{\%} (95{\%} CI, 84{\%}-89{\%}) of combination therapy patients continued to receive TCZ at 6 months (log-rank p{\textless}0.001). During the observation period, TCZ was discontinued by 113 (22.3{\%}) monotherapy patients and 116 (14.0{\%}) patients on combination therapy. The mean prednisone-equivalent oral corticosteroid dose was 8.4 mg/day for monotherapy and combination therapy patients at baseline and 7.7 and 7.6 mg/day, respectively, at month 6. Adverse events or laboratory abnormalities requiring TCZ dose modification were reported for 66 (13.0{\%}) monotherapy and 130 (15.7{\%}) combination therapy patients. Effectiveness at 6 months was similar between groups; mean (SD) change from baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was -20.3 (14.18) for monotherapy and -22.3 (16.09) for combination therapy (p=0.7347). CONCLUSIONS In routine clinical practice, 38{\%} of patients received TCZ as monotherapy. Persistence on monotherapy or in combination therapy with csDMARDs was high, with a slight trend towards a higher rate with combination therapy, and effectiveness was similar between groups.},

abstract = {The gene silencing transcription factor REST [repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor]/NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencer factor) actively represses a large array of coding and noncoding neuron-specific genes important to synaptic plasticity including miR-132. miR-132 is a neuron-specific microRNA and plays a pivotal role in synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity and structural remodeling. However, a role for miR-132 in neuronal death is not, as yet, well-delineated. Here we show that ischemic insults promote REST binding and epigenetic remodeling at the miR-132 promoter and silencing of miR-132 expression in selectively vulnerable hippocampal CA1 neurons. REST occupancy was not altered at the miR-9 or miR-124a promoters despite the presence of repressor element 1 sites, indicating REST target specificity. Ischemia induced a substantial decrease in two marks of active gene transcription, dimethylation of lysine 4 on core histone 3 (H3K4me2) and acetylation of lysine 9 on H3 (H3K9ac) at the miR-132 promoter. RNAi-mediated depletion of REST in vivo blocked ischemia-induced loss of miR-132 in insulted hippocampal neurons, consistent with a causal relation between activation of REST and silencing of miR-132. Overexpression of miR-132 in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons or delivered directly into the CA1 of living rats by means of the lentiviral expression system prior to induction of ischemia afforded robust protection against ischemia-induced neuronal death. These findings document a previously unappreciated role for REST-dependent repression of miR-132 in the neuronal death associated with global ischemia and identify a novel therapeutic target for amelioration of the neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits associated with ischemic stroke.},

abstract = {for the Karolinska Schizophrenia Project Consortium IMPORTANCE Between-individual variability in brain structure is determined by gene-environment interactions, possibly reflecting differential sensitivity to environmental and genetic perturbations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have revealed thinner cortices and smaller subcortical volumes in patients with schizophrenia. However, group-level comparisons may mask considerable within-group heterogeneity, which has largely remained unnoticed in the literature. OBJECTIVES To compare brain structural variability between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls and to test whether respective variability reflects the polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia in an independent sample of healthy controls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This case-control and polygenic risk analysis compared MRI-derived cortical thickness and subcortical volumes between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia across 16 cohorts and tested for associations between PRS and MRI features in a control cohort from the UK Biobank. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean and dispersion parameters were estimated using double generalized linear models. Vertex-wise analysis was used to assess cortical thickness, and regions-of-interest analyses were used to assess total cortical volume, total surface area, and white matter, subcortical, and hippocampal subfield volumes. Follow-up analyses included within-sample analysis, test of robustness of the PRS threshold, population covariates, outlier removal, and control for image quality. RESULTS A comparison of 1151 patients with schizophrenia (mean [SD] age, 33.8 [10.6] years; 68.6{\%} male [n = 790] and 31.4{\%} female [n = 361]) with 2010 healthy controls (mean [SD] age, 32.6 [10.4] years; 56.0{\%} male [n = 1126] and 44.0{\%} female [n = 884]) revealed higher heterogeneity in schizophrenia for cortical thickness and area (t = 3.34), cortical (t = 3.24) and ventricle (t range, 3.15-5.78) volumes, and hippocampal subfields (t range, 2.32-3.55). In the UK Biobank sample of 12 490 participants (mean [SD] age, 55.9 [7.5] years; 48.2{\%} male [n = 6025] and 51.8{\%} female [n = 6465]), higher PRS was associated with thinner frontal and temporal cortices and smaller left CA2/3 (t = −3.00) but was not significantly associated with dispersion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that schizophrenia is associated with substantial brain structural heterogeneity beyond the mean differences. These findings may reflect higher sensitivity to environmental and genetic perturbations in patients, supporting the heterogeneous nature of schizophrenia. A higher PRS was associated with thinner frontotemporal cortices and smaller hippocampal subfield volume, but not heterogeneity. This finding suggests that brain variability in schizophrenia results from interactions between environmental and genetic factors that are not captured by the PRS. Factors contributing to heterogeneity in frontotemporal cortices and hippocampus are key to furthering our understanding of how genetic and environmental factors shape brain biology in schizophrenia.},

The severity of these symptoms ranges from minor executive symptoms to frank dementia involving multiple domains. In the present review, we will concentrate on the aspects of cognitive impairment associated with prefrontal dopaminergic dysfunction seen in non- demented patients with PD. These symptoms include executive dysfunction and disorders of thought such as hallucinations and psychosis. Such symptoms may go on to predict dementia related to Parkinson's disease, which involves amnestic dysfunction and is typically seen later in the disease. Cognitive symptoms are associated with dysfunction in cholinergic circuits in addition to the abnormalities in the prefrontal dopaminergic system. These circuits can be carefully studied and evaluated in Parkinson's disease, and could be leveraged to treat difficult clinical problems related to cognitive symptoms of PD. Introduction},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulatory RNAs known to repress mRNA translation through recognition of specific binding sites located mainly in their 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Loss of specific miRNA control of gene expression is thus expected to underlie serious genetic diseases. Intriguingly, previous post-mortem analyses showed higher beta-amyloid precursor protein-converting enzyme (BACE) protein, but not mRNA, levels in the brain of patients that suffered from Alzheimer disease (AD). Here we also observed a loss of correlation between BACE1 mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus of a mouse model of AD. Consistent with an impairment of miRNA-mediated regulation of BACE1 expression, these findings prompted us to investigate the regulatory role of the BACE1 3'-UTR element and the possible involvement of specific miRNAs in cultured neuronal (N2a) and fibroblastic (NIH 3T3) cells. Through various experimental approaches, we validated computational predictions and demonstrated that miR-298 and miR-328 recognize specific binding sites in the 3'-UTR of BACE1 mRNA and exert regulatory effects on BACE1 protein expression in cultured neuronal cells. Our results may provide the molecular basis underlying BACE1 deregulation in AD and offer new perspectives on the etiology of this neurological disorder.},

The lanthanum salt of extracted protein-polysaccharide precipitates when the concentration of LaCl(3) is decreased. Precipitation is complete in the presence of 0.05m-LaCl(3). This finding is relevant to the interpretation of earlier observations on the effect of LaCl(3) on elastic recovery of articular cartilage after compression (Sokoloff, 1963). 4.

On the basis of this relationship a hypothesis is proposed to explain the characteristic protein-polysaccharide-extraction profiles exhibited by inorganic salt solutions.},

abstract = {HIGHLIGHTSPsychological stress activates neuroendocrine pathways that alter immune responses.Stress-induced alterations in microglia phenotype and monocyte priming leads to aberrant peripheral and central inflammation.Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels caused by microglia activation and recruitment of monocytes to the brain contribute to development and persistent anxiety-like behavior.Mechanisms that mediate interactions between microglia, endothelial cells, and macrophages and how these contribute to changes in behavior are discussed.Sensitization of microglia and re-distribution of primed monocytes are implicated in re-establishment of anxiety-like behavior. Psychological stress causes physiological, immunological, and behavioral alterations in humans and rodents that can be maladaptive and negatively affect quality of life. Several lines of evidence indicate that psychological stress disrupts key functional interactions between the immune system and brain that ultimately affects mood and behavior. For example, activation of microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the brain, has been implicated as a key regulator of mood and behavior in the context of prolonged exposure to psychological stress. Emerging evidence implicates a novel neuroimmune circuit involving microglia activation and sympathetic outflow to the peripheral immune system that further reinforces stress-related behaviors by facilitating the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the brain. Evidence from various rodent models, including repeated social defeat (RSD), revealed that trafficking of monocytes to the brain promoted the establishment of anxiety-like behaviors following prolonged stress exposure. In addition, new evidence implicates monocyte trafficking from the spleen to the brain as key regulator of recurring anxiety following exposure to prolonged stress. The purpose of this review is to discuss mechanisms that cause stress-induced monocyte re-distribution in the brain and how dynamic interactions between microglia, endothelial cells, and brain macrophages lead to maladaptive behavioral responses.},

abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that have been linked to a number of disease-related signal transduction pathways. Several studies indicate that they are also involved in nociception. It is not clear, however, which miRNAs are important and which genes are modulated by miRNA-associated mechanisms. This study focuses on the regulation and function of the central nervous system (CNS)-specific miRNA-124a in the spinal cord of mice in a formalin model of inflammatory nociception. miRNA-124a is constitutively expressed in the spinal cord of mice, particularly in neurons of the dorsal horn. Peripheral noxious stimulation with formalin led to significant down-regulation of its expression. Knock-down of miRNA-124a by intravenous administration of a specific miRNA-124a inhibitor further increased the nociceptive behavior associated with an upregulation of the pain-relevant miRNA-124a target MeCP2 and proinflammatory marker genes. In contrast, administration of a miRNA-124a mimic counteracted these effects and decreased nociception by down-regulation of the target gene. In conclusion, our results indicate that miRNA-124a is involved in inflammatory nociception by regulation of relevant target proteins and might therefore constitute a novel target for anti-inflammatory therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with psychotic disorders are often treated with numerous medications, many of which have anticholinergic activity. We assessed cognition in relation to the cumulative anticholinergic burden of multiple drugs included in treatment regimens of participants from the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) study. METHOD Clinically stable participants with schizophrenia (n=206), schizoaffective disorder (n=131), and psychotic bipolar disorder (n=146) were examined. Anticholinergic properties of all scheduled drugs were quantified using the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS). ADS scores were summed across individual drugs to create a total ADS burden score for each participant and examined in relation to the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS). RESULTS Anticholinergic burden aggregated across all medications was inversely related to cognitive performance starting at ADS scores of 4 in participants with schizophrenia. Those with ADS scores ≥4 had lower composite BACS scores compared to those with ADS{\textless}4 (p=0.004). Among BACS subtests, Verbal Memory was the most adversely affected by high anticholinergic burden. Despite similar anticholinergic burden scores across groups, a significant threshold effect of anticholinergic burden was not detected in schizoaffective or psychotic bipolar disorder. CONCLUSION We identified an adverse effect threshold of anticholinergic burden on cognition in clinically stable participants with schizophrenia. This relationship was not identified in affective psychoses. Examination of other medications, doses, and clinical measures did not account for these findings. Patients with schizophrenia may have increased cognitive susceptibility to anticholinergic medications and the aggregate effects of one's medication regimen may be important to consider in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Almost all degenerative diseases of the CNS are associated with chronic inflammation. A central step in this process is the activation of brain mononuclear phagocyte cells, called microglia. While it is recognized that healthy neurons and astrocytes regulate the magnitude of microglia-mediated innate immune responses and limit excessive CNS inflammation, the endogenous signals governing this process are not fully understood. In the peripheral nervous system, recent studies suggest that an endogenous 'cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway' regulates systemic inflammatory responses via alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptors (nAChR) found on blood-borne macrophages. These data led us to investigate whether a similar cholinergic pathway exists in the brain that could regulate microglial activation. Here we report for the first time that cultured microglial cells express alpha 7 nAChR subunit as determined by RT-PCR, western blot, immunofluorescent, and immunohistochemistry analyses. Acetylcholine and nicotine pre-treatment inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF-alpha release in murine-derived microglial cells, an effect attenuated by alpha 7 selective nicotinic antagonist, alpha-bungarotoxin. Furthermore, this inhibition appears to be mediated by a reduction in phosphorylation of p44/42 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Though preliminary, our findings suggest the existence of a brain cholinergic pathway that regulates microglial activation through alpha 7 nicotinic receptors. Negative regulation of microglia activation may also represent additional mechanism underlying nicotine's reported neuroprotective properties.},

Altered expression of miRNAs is increasingly recognized as a feature of many disease states, including neurodegeneration. Here, we review the emerging role for miRNA dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease pathogenesis. We emphasize the complex nature of gene regulatory networks and the need for systematic studies, with larger sample cohorts than have so far been reported, to reveal the most important miRNA regulators in disease. Finally, miRNA diversity and their potential to target multiple pathways, offers novel clinical applications for miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic agents in neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Genome wide association studies (GWAS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) have previously revealed a significant association with a locus on chromosome 7p15.3, initially designated as the glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) locus. In this study, the functional consequences of this association on expression were explored in depth by integrating different expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) datasets (Braineac, CAGEseq, GTEx, and Phenotype-Genotype Integrator (PheGenI)). Top risk SNP rs199347 eQTLs demonstrated increased expressions of GPNMB, KLHL7, and NUPL2 with the major allele (AA) in brain, with most significant eQTLs in cortical regions, followed by putamen. In addition, decreased expression of the antisense RNA KLHL7-AS1 was observed in GTEx. Furthermore, rs199347 is an eQTL with long non-coding RNA (AC005082.12) in human tissues other than brain. Interestingly, transcript-specific eQTLs in immune-related tissues (spleen and lymphoblastoid cells) for NUPL2 and KLHL7-AS1 were observed, which suggests a complex functional role of this eQTL in specific tissues, cell types at specific time points. Significantly increased expression of GPNMB linked to rs199347 was consistent across all datasets, and taken in combination with the risk SNP being located within the GPNMB gene, these results suggest that increased expression of GPNMB is the causative link explaining the association of this locus with PD. However, other transcript eQTLs and subsequent functional roles cannot be excluded. This highlights the importance of further investigations to understand the functional interactions between the coding genes, antisense, and non-coding RNA species considering the tissue and cell-type specificity to understand the underlying biological mechanisms in PD.},

Although genes related to immunity are implicated in schizophrenia, there has been no study showing that their mutation or knockout (KO) results in schizophrenia. Here, we show that Shn-2 KO mice have behavioral abnormalities that resemble those of schizophrenics. The mutant brain demonstrated multiple schizophrenia-related phenotypes, including transcriptome/proteome changes similar to those of postmortem schizophrenia patients, decreased parvalbumin and GAD67 levels, increased theta power on electroencephalograms, and a thinner cortex. Dentate gyrus granule cells failed to mature in mutants, a previously proposed endophenotype of schizophrenia. Shn-2 KO mice also exhibited mild chronic inflammation of the brain, as evidenced by increased inflammation markers (including GFAP and NADH/NADPH oxidase p22 phox), and genome-wide gene expression patterns similar to various inflammatory conditions. Chronic administration of anti-inflammatory drugs reduced hippocampal GFAP expression, and reversed deficits in working memory and nest-building behaviors in Shn-2 KO mice. These results suggest that genetically induced changes in immune system can be a predisposing factor in schizophrenia.},

It is a complex disorder with both environmental and genetic components. Current diagnosis of AD is based primarily on the analysis of the patient's cognitive function using imaging techniques and the biochemical analyses of bodily fluids. Efforts have been made to develop not only an effective therapeutic, but also a diagnostic capable of identifying AD before the onset of irreversible neurological damage. The molecular content of exosomes is a fingerprint of the releasing cell type and its status. A significant body of literature has demonstrated that molecular constituents of exosomes, especially exosomal proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs), hold great promise as novel biomarkers for clinical diagnosis. In addition, expression profiling of miRNAs found in nanovesicles has revealed diagnostic potential in neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, exosomal miRNAs within biological fluids are known as good disease-related markers, and have emerged as a powerful tool for solving many difficulties in both the diagnosis and treatment of AD patients. In this review, we reviewed recent advances in the research of exosomal biomarkers as well as exosomal miRNAs, summarized of actively used approaches to identifying potential miRNA biomarkers through mouse models and their potential application in clinical diagnostics in AD. We also supply a comprehensive overview of the formation, function, and isolation of exosomes.},

abstract = {A body of experimental evidence suggests that T cells mediate neuroprotection following CNS injury; however, the antigen specificity of these T cells and how they mediate neuroprotection are unknown. Here, we have provided evidence that T cell–mediated neuroprotection after CNS injury can occur independently of major histocompatibility class II (MHCII) signaling to T cell receptors (TCRs). Using two murine models of CNS injury, we determined that damage-associated molecular mediators that originate from injured CNS tissue induce a population of neuroprotective, IL-4–producing T cells in an antigenindependent fashion. Compared with wild-type mice, IL-4–deficient animals had decreased functional recovery following CNS injury; however, transfer of CD4+ T cells from wild-type mice, but not from IL-4–deficient mice, enhanced neuronal survival. Using a culture-based system, we determined that T cell–derived IL-4 protects and induces recovery of injured neurons by activation of neuronal IL-4 receptors, which potentiated neurotrophin signaling via the AKT and MAPK pathways. Together, these findings demonstrate that damage-associated molecules from the injured CNS induce a neuroprotective T cell response that is independent of MHCII/TCR interactions and is MyD88 dependent. Moreover, our results indicate that IL-4 mediates neuroprotection and recovery of the injured CNS and suggest that strategies to enhance IL-4–producing CD4+ T cells have potential to attenuate axonal damage in the course of CNS injury in trauma, inflammation, or neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Although acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is primarily a hydrolytic enzyme, metabolising the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses, it also has some non-catalytic functions in the brain which are far less well characterised. AChE was shown to be secreted or shed from the neuronal cell surface like several other membrane proteins, such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Since AChE does not possess a transmembrane domain, its anchorage in the membrane is established via the Proline Rich Membrane Anchor (PRiMA), a transmembrane protein. Both the subunit oligomerisation and membrane anchor of AChE are shared by a related enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), the physiological function of which in the brain is unclear. In this work, we have assayed the relative activities of AChE and BChE in membrane fractions and culture medium of three different neuronal cell lines, namely the neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y and NB7 and the mouse basal forebrain cell line SN56. In an effort to understand the shedding process of AChE, we have used several pharmacological treatments, which showed that it is likely to be mediated in part by an EDTA- and batimastat-sensitive, but GM6001-insensitive metalloprotease, with the possible additional involvement of a thiol isomerase. Cellular release of AChE by SH-SY5Y is significantly enhanced by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonists carbachol or muscarine, with the effect of carbachol blocked by the mAChR antagonist atropine. AChE has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and it has been shown that it accelerates formation and increases toxicity of amyloid fibrils, which have been closely linked to the pathology of AD. In light of this, greater understanding of AChE and BChE physiology may also benefit AD research.},

Some authors have suggested a function of AChEIs not only in the induction of AChE overproduction and alternative splicing shifts but also a possible role of these drugs in amyloid metabolism beyond their well-known symptomatic effect. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of action of the AChEI donepezil on APP (amyloid precursor protein) metabolism and on the activity/trafficking of the alpha-secretase candidate ADAM 10, in differentiated human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). In these cells, the activity of AChE is significantly decreased after 2 h of donepezil treatment. Further, SH-SY5Y cells released significantly more sAPPalpha into the medium, whereas total APP levels in cell lysates were unchanged. Interestingly, treated cells showed increased ADAM 10 levels in membrane compartments. This effect was prevented by pretreatment with tunicamycin or brefeldin, suggesting that donepezil affects trafficking and/or maturation of ADAM 10; additionally, this pretreatment significantly decreased sAPPalpha levels. Pre-incubation with atropine decreased release of sAPPalpha significantly but did not revert ADAM 10 activity to control levels further suggesting that donepezil acts not solely through a purely receptor mediated pathway. These findings indicate that donepezil exerts multiple mechanisms involving processing and trafficking of key proteins involved in AD pathogenesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We used RNA sequencing to analyze transcript profiles of ten autopsy brain regions from ten subjects. RNA sequencing techniques were designed to detect both coding and non-coding RNA, splice isoform composition, and allelic expression. Brain regions were selected from five subjects with a documented history of smoking and five non-smokers. Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed on SOLiD instruments to a depth of {\textgreater}40 million reads, using linearly amplified, ribosomally depleted RNA. Sequencing libraries were prepared with both poly-dT and random hexamer primers to detect all RNA classes, including long non-coding (lncRNA), intronic and intergenic transcripts, and transcripts lacking poly-A tails, providing additional data not previously available. The study was designed to generate a database of the complete transcriptomes in brain region for gene network analyses and discovery of regulatory variants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 20,318 protein coding and 18,080 lncRNA genes annotated from GENCODE and lncipedia, 12 thousand protein coding and 2 thousand lncRNA transcripts were detectable at a conservative threshold. Of the aligned reads, 52 {\%} were exonic, 34 {\%} intronic and 14 {\%} intergenic. A majority of protein coding genes (65 {\%}) was expressed in all regions, whereas ncRNAs displayed a more restricted distribution. Profiles of RNA isoforms varied across brain regions and subjects at multiple gene loci, with neurexin 3 (NRXN3) a prominent example. Allelic RNA ratios deviating from unity were identified in {\textgreater} 400 genes, detectable in both protein-coding and non-coding genes, indicating the presence of cis-acting regulatory variants. Mathematical modeling was used to identify RNAs stably expressed in all brain regions (serving as potential markers for normalizing expression levels), linked to basic cellular functions. An initial analysis of differential expression analysis between smokers and nonsmokers implicated a number of genes, several previously associated with nicotine exposure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: RNA sequencing identifies distinct and consistent differences in gene expression between brain regions, with non-coding RNA displaying greater diversity between brain regions than mRNAs. Numerous RNAs exhibit robust allele selective expression, proving a means for discovery of cis-acting regulatory factors with potential clinical relevance.},

@article{Maletic2014,
abstract = {From a neurobiological perspective there is no such thing as bipolar disorder. Rather, it is almost certainly the case that many somewhat similar, but subtly different, pathological conditions produce a disease state that we currently diagnose as bipolarity. This heterogeneity - reflected in the lack of synergy between our current diagnostic schema and our rapidly advancing scientific understanding of the condition - limits attempts to articulate an integrated perspective on bipolar disorder. However, despite these challenges, scientific findings in recent years are beginning to offer a provisional "unified field theory" of the disease. This theory sees bipolar disorder as a suite of related neurodevelopmental conditions with interconnected functional abnormalities that often appear early in life and worsen over time. In addition to accelerated loss of volume in brain areas known to be essential for mood regulation and cognitive function, consistent findings have emerged at a cellular level, providing evidence that bipolar disorder is reliably associated with dysregulation of glial-neuronal interactions. Among these glial elements are microglia - the brain's primary immune elements, which appear to be overactive in the context of bipolarity. Multiple studies now indicate that inflammation is also increased in the periphery of the body in both the depressive and manic phases of the illness, with at least some return to normality in the euthymic state. These findings are consistent with changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which are known to drive inflammatory activation. In summary, the very fact that no single gene, pathway, or brain abnormality is likely to ever account for the condition is itself an extremely important first step in better articulating an integrated perspective on both its ontological status and pathogenesis. Whether this perspective will translate into the discovery of innumerable more homogeneous forms of bipolarity is one of the great questions facing the field and one that is likely to have profound treatment implications, given that fact that such a discovery would greatly increase our ability to individualize - and by extension, enhance - treatment.},

abstract = {Neuropsychiatric disorders are common health problems affecting approximately 1{\%} of the population. Twin, adoption, and family studies have displayed a strong genetic component for many of these disorders; however, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and neural substrates remain largely unknown. Given the critical need for new diagnostic markers and disease-modifying treatments, expanding the focus of genomic studies of neuropsychiatric disorders to include the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is of growing interest. Of known types of ncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) are 20–25-nucleotide, single-stranded, molecules that regulate gene expression through post-transcriptional mechanisms and have the potential to coordinately regulate complex regulatory networks. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on miRNA alteration/dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders, with a special emphasis on schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). With an eye toward the future, we also discuss the diagnostic and prognostic potential of miRNAs for neuropsychiatric disorders in the context of personalized treatments and network medicine.},

The temporal course of this lesion and its relationship to other aspects of the disease have not yet been fully clarified. Despite assertions to the contrary, a review of the evidence suggests that a perturbation of cholinergic innervation is likely to be present even in the very early stages of AD. This cholinergic lesion is unlikely to be a major determinant of the clinical symptoms or of the neuropathological lesions. Nonetheless, it almost certainly contributes to the severity of the cognitive and behavioral deficits, especially in the areas of memory and attention. The cholinergic lesion may also influence the progression of the neuropathological process through complex interactions with amyloidogenesis, tau phosphorylation and neuroplasticity.},

abstract = {Since its discovery almost three decades ago, the secreted neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been firmly implicated in the differentiation and survival of neurons of the CNS. More recently, BDNF has also emerged as an important regulator of synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity mechanisms underlying learning and memory in the adult CNS. In this review we will discuss our knowledge about the multiple intracellular signalling pathways activated by BDNF, and the role of this neurotrophin in long-term synaptic plasticity and memory formation as well as in synaptogenesis. We will show that maturation of BDNF, its cellular localisation and its ability to regulate both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the CNS may result in conflicting alterations in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Lack of a precise knowledge about the mechanisms by which BDNF influences higher cognitive functions and complex behaviours may constitute a severe limitation in the possibility to devise BDNF-based therapeutics for human disorders of the CNS.},

@article{Grisaru1999,
abstract = {Apart from its catalytic function in hydrolyzing acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) affects cell proliferation, differentiation and responses to various insults, including stress. These responses are at least in part specific to the three C-terminal variants of AChE which are produced by alternative splicing of the single ACHE gene. 'Synaptic' AChE-S constitutes the principal multimeric enzyme in brain and muscle; soluble, monomeric 'readthrough' AChE-R appears in embryonic and tumor cells and is induced under psychological, chemical and physical stress; and glypiated dimers of erythrocytic AChE-E associate with red blood cell membranes. We postulate that the homology of AChE to the cell adhesion proteins, gliotactin, glutactin and the neurexins, which have more established functions in nervous system development, is the basis of its morphogenic functions. Competition between AChE variants and their homologs on interactions with the corresponding protein partners would inevitably modify cellular signaling. This can explain why AChE-S exerts process extension from cultured amphibian, avian and mammalian glia and neurons in a manner that is C-terminus-dependent, refractory to several active site inhibitors and, in certain cases, redundant to the function of AChE-like proteins. Structural functions of AChE variants can explain their proliferative and developmental roles in blood, bone, retinal and neuronal cells. Moreover, the association of AChE excess with amyloid plaques in the degenerating human brain and with progressive cognitive and neuromotor deficiencies observed in AChE-transgenic animal models most likely reflects the combined contributions of catalytic and structural roles.},

abstract = {Paired helical filaments (PHF) are the principal pathologic components of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To reproduce the formation of PHF in tissue culture, we stably expressed human tau with and without pathogenic mutations in human SH-SY5Y cells and exposed them for 5 days to aggregated synthetic beta-amyloid peptide (A beta 42). This caused a decreased solubility of tau along with the generation of PHF-like tau-containing filaments. These were 20 nm wide and had periodicities of 130-140 nm in the presence of P301L mutant tau or 150-160 nm in the presence of wild-type tau. Mutagenesis of the phosphoepitope serine 422 of tau prevented both the A beta 42-mediated decrease in solubility and the generation of PHF-like filaments, suggesting a role of serine 422 or its phosphorylation in tau filament formation. Together, our data underscore a role of A beta 42 in the formation of PHF-like filaments. Our culture system will be useful to map phosphoepitopes of tau involved in PHF formation and to identify and characterize modifiers of the tau pathology. Further adaptation of the system may allow the screening and validation of compounds designed to prevent PHF formation.},

abstract = {Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves loss of cholinergic neurons and Tau protein hyper-phosphorylation. Here, we report that overexpression of an N-terminally extended synaptic acetylcholinesterase variant, N-AChE-S is causally involved in both these phenomena. Methodology and Principal Findings: In transfected primary brain cultures, N-AChE-S induced cell death, morphological impairments and caspase 3 activation. Rapid internalization of fluorescently labeled fasciculin-2 to N-AChE-S transfected cells indicated membranal localization. In cultured cell lines, N-AChE-S transfection activated the Tau kinase GSK3, induced Tau hyper-phosphorylation and caused apoptosis. N-AChE-S-induced cell death was suppressible by inhibiting GSK3 or caspases, by enforced overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins, or by AChE inhibition or silencing. Moreover, inherent N-AChE-S was upregulated by stressors inducing protein misfolding and calcium imbalances, both characteristic of AD; and in cortical tissues from AD patients, N-AChE-S overexpression coincides with Tau hyper-phosphorylation. Conclusions: Together, these findings attribute an apoptogenic role to N-AChE-S and outline a potential value to AChE inhibitor therapeutics in early AD.},

Here we introduce the basic idea behind the experimental identification of miRNA targets and present some of the most widely used computational miRNA target identification programs. The review includes an assessment of the prediction quality of these programs and their combinations. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder with a world-wide prevalence of 1{\%}. The pathophysiology of the illness is not understood, but is thought to have a strong genetic component with some environmental influences on aetiology. To gain further insight into disease mechanism, we used microarray technology to determine the expression of over 30 000 mRNA transcripts in post-mortem tissue from a brain region associated with the pathophysiology of the disease (Brodmann area 10: anterior prefrontal cortex) in 28 schizophrenic and 23 control patients. We then compared our study (Charing Cross Hospital prospective collection) with that of an independent prefrontal cortex dataset from the Harvard Brain Bank. We report the first direct comparison between two independent studies. A total of 51 gene expression changes have been identified that are common between the schizophrenia cohorts, and 49 show the same direction of disease-associated regulation. In particular, changes were observed in gene sets associated with synaptic vesicle recycling, transmitter release and cytoskeletal dynamics. This strongly suggests multiple, small but synergistic changes in gene expression that affect nerve terminal function.},

abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, functional, non-coding RNAs. miRNAs are transcribed as long primary transcripts (primary precursors) that are processed to the approximately 75 nt precursors (pre-miRNAs) by the nuclear enzyme Drosha. The approximately 22 nt mature miRNA is processed from the pre-miRNA by the RNase III Dicer. The vast majority of published studies to date have used northern blotting to detect the expression of miRNAs. We describe here a sensitive, high throughput, real-time PCR assay to monitor the expression of miRNA precursors. Gene-specific primers and reverse transcriptase were used to convert the primary precursors and pre-miRNAs to cDNA. The expression of 23 miRNA precursors in six human cancer cell lines was assayed using the PCR assay. The miRNA precursors accumulated to different levels when compared with each other or when a single precursor is compared in the various cell lines. The precursor expression profile of three miRNAs determined by the PCR assay was identical to the mature miRNA expression profile determined by northern blotting. We propose that the PCR assay may be scaled up to include all of the 150+ known human miRNA genes and can easily be adaptable to other organisms such as plants, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila.},

abstract = {MiR-100 and miR-125b are lost in many cancers and have potential function as tumor suppressors. Using both primary prostatic epithelial cultures and laser capture-microdissected prostate epithelium from 45 patients enrolled in a vitamin D3 randomized trial, we identified miR-100 and -125b as targets of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D). In patients, miR-100 and -125b levels were significantly lower in tumor tissue than in benign prostate. Similarly, miR-100 and -125b were lower in primary prostate cancer cells than in cells derived from benign prostate. Prostatic concentrations of 1,25D positively correlated with these miRNA levels in both prostate cancer and benign epithelium, showing that patients with prostate cancer may still benefit from vitamin D3. In cell assays, upregulation of these miRNAs by 1,25D was vitamin D receptor dependent. Transfection of pre-miR-100 and pre-miR-125b in the presence or absence of 1,25D decreased invasiveness of cancer cell, RWPE-2. Pre-miR-100 and pre-miR-125b decreased proliferation in primary cells and cancer cells respectively. Pre-miR-125b transfection suppressed migration and clonal growth of prostate cancer cells, whereas knockdown of miR-125b in normal cells increased migration indicates a tumor suppressor function. 1,25D suppressed expression of previously bona fide mRNA targets of these miRNAs, E2F3 and Plk1, in a miRNA-dependent manner. Together, these findings show that vitamin D3 supplementation augments tumor suppressive miRNAs in patient prostate tissue, providing evidence that miRNAs could be key physiologic mediators of vitamin D3 activity in prevention and early treatment of prostate cancer.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is used extensively to characterize the transcriptome of cells. Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Various quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential gene expression analyses on simple count matrices but that this can be addressed by incorporating offsets derived from transcript-level abundance estimates. We also show that the problem is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport) to help users integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference engines.},

abstract = {The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) protein is a major transcription factor involved in many cellular processes, such as cell growth and proliferation, differentiation, migration, and cell death or cell apoptosis. It is activated in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli including cytokines and growth factors. The aberrant activation of STAT3 contributes to several human diseases, particularly cancer. Consequently, STAT3-mediated signaling continues to be extensively studied in order to identify potential targets for the development of new and more effective clinical therapeutics. STAT3 activation can be regulated, either positively or negatively, by different posttranslational mechanisms including serine or tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, acetylation, or demethylation. One of the major mechanisms that negatively regulates STAT3 activation is dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residue essential for its activation by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). There are seven PTPs that have been shown to dephosphorylate STAT3 and, thereby, regulate STAT3 signaling: PTP receptor-type D (PTPRD), PTP receptor-type T (PTPRT), PTP receptor-type K (PTPRK), Src homology region 2 (SH-2) domain-containing phosphatase 1(SHP1), SH-2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2), MEG2/PTP non-receptor type 9 (PTPN9), and T-cell PTP (TC-PTP)/PTP non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2). These regulators have great potential as targets for the development of more effective therapies against human disease, including cancer.},

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In animals, microRNAs (miRNA) are important genetic regulators. Animal miRNAs appear to have expanded in conjunction with an escalation in complexity during early bilaterian evolution. Their small size and high-degree of similarity makes them challenging for phylogenetic approaches. Furthermore, genomic locations encoding miRNAs are not clearly defined in many species. A number of studies have looked at the evolution of individual miRNA families. However, we currently lack resources for large-scale analysis of miRNA evolution.RESULTS:We addressed some of these issues in order to analyse the evolution of miRNAs. We perform syntenic and phylogenetic analysis for miRNAs from 80 animal species. We present synteny maps, phylogenies and functional data for miRNAs across these species. These data represent the basis of our analyses and also act as a resource for the community.CONCLUSIONS:We use these data to explore the distribution of miRNAs across phylogenetic space, characterise their birth and death, and examine functional relationships between miRNAs and other genes. These data confirm a number of previously reported findings on a larger scale and also offer novel insights into the evolution of the miRNA repertoire in animals, and it's genomic organization.},

abstract = {Dysfunction in the monoamine systems of serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) may causally be related to major depressive disorder (MDD). Monoamine depletion studies investigate the direct effects of monoamines on mood. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) or para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) deplete 5-HT, acute phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion (APTD) or alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT) deplete NE/DA. Available depletion studies found conflicting results in heterogeneous populations: healthy controls, patients with previous MDD in remission and patients suffering from MDD. The decrease in mood after 5-HT and NE/DA depletion in humans is reviewed and quantified. Systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1966-October 2006) and cross-references was carried out. Randomized studies applying ATD, PCPA, APTD or AMPT vs control depletion were included. Pooling of results by meta-analyses was stratified for studied population and design of the study (within or between subjects). Seventy-three ATD, 2 PCPA, 10 APTD and 8 AMPT studies were identified of which 45 ATD and 8 APTD studies could be meta-analyzed. 5-HT or NE/DA depletion did not decrease mood in healthy controls. 5-HT or NE/DA depletion slightly lowered mood in healthy controls with a family history of MDD. In drug-free patients with MDD in remission, a moderate mood decrease was found for ATD, without an effect of APTD. ATD induced relapse in patients with MDD in remission who used serotonergic antidepressants. In conclusion, monoamine depletion studies demonstrate decreased mood in subjects with a family history of MDD and in drug-free patients with MDD in remission, but do not decrease mood in healthy humans. Although depletion studies usefully investigate the etiological link of 5-HT and NE with MDD, they fail to demonstrate a causal relation. They presumably clarify a vulnerability trait to become depressed. Directions for further investigation of this vulnerability trait are proposed.},

abstract = {Neprilysin is one of the major amyloid-$\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$)-degrading enzymes, the expression of which declines in the brain during aging. The decrease in neprilysin leads to a metabolic A$\beta$ imbalance, which can induce the amyloidosis underlying Alzheimer disease. Pharmacological activation of neprilysin during aging therefore represents a potential strategy to prevent the development of Alzheimer disease. However, the regulatory mechanisms mediating neprilysin activity in the brain remain unclear. To address this issue, we screened for pharmacological regulators of neprilysin activity and found that the neurotrophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, and neurotrophins 3 and 4 reduce cell surface neprilysin activity. This decrease was mediated by MEK/ERK signaling, which enhanced phosphorylation at serine 6 in the neprilysin intracellular domain (S6-NEP-ICD). Increased phosphorylation of S6-NEP-ICD in primary neurons reduced the levels of cell surface neprilysin and led to a subsequent increase in extracellular A$\beta$ levels. Furthermore, a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1a, tautomycetin, induced extensive phosphorylation of the S6-NEP-ICD, resulting in reduced cell surface neprilysin activity. In contrast, activation of protein phosphatase-1a increased cell surface neprilysin activity and lowered A$\beta$ levels. Taken together, these results indicate that the phosphorylation status of S6-NEP-ICD influences the localization of neprilysin and affects extracellular A$\beta$ levels. Therefore, maintaining S6-NEP-ICD in a dephosphorylated state, either by inhibition of protein kinases involved in its phosphorylation or by activation of phosphatases catalyzing its dephosphorylation, may represent a new approach to prevent reduction of cell surface neprilysin activity during aging and to maintain physiological levels of A$\beta$ in the brain.},

abstract = {The role of the immune system in schizophrenia remains controversial despite numerous studies to date. Most studies have profiled expression of select genes or proteins in peripheral blood, but none have focused on the expression of canonical pathways that mediate overall immune response. The current study used a systematic genetic approach to investigate the role of the immune system in a large sample of post-mortem brain of patients with schizophrenia: RNA sequencing was performed to assess the differential expression of 561 immune genes and 20 immune pathways in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (144 schizophrenia and 196 control subjects) and hippocampus (83 schizophrenia and 187 control subjects). The effect of RNA quality on gene expression was found to be highly correlated with the effect of diagnosis even after adjustment for observable RNA quality parameters (i.e. RNA integrity), thus this confounding relationship was statistically controlled using principal components derived from the gene expression matrix. In DLPFC, 23 immune genes were found to be differentially expressed (false discovery rate {\textless}0.05), of which seven genes replicated in both directionality and at nominal significance (P{\textless}0.05) in an independent post-mortem DLPFC data set (182 schizophrenia and 212 control subjects), although notably at least five of these genes have prominent roles in pathways other than immune function and overall the effect sizes were minimal (fold change {\textless}1.1). In the hippocampus, no individual immune genes were identified to be differentially expressed, and in both DLPFC and hippocampus none of the individual immune pathways were relatively differentially expressed. Further, genomic schizophrenia risk profiles scores were not correlated with the expression of individual immune pathways or differentially expressed genes. Overall, past reports claiming a primary pathogenic role of the immune system intrinsic to the brain in schizophrenia could not be confirmed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Given multiple studies of brain microRNA (miRNA) in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) with few consistent results and the heterogeneity of this disease, the objective of this study was to explore their mechanism by evaluating their relation to different elements of Alzheimer's disease pathology, confounding factors and mRNA expression data from the same subjects in the same brain region. METHODS We report analyses of expression profiling of miRNA (n = 700 subjects) and lincRNA (n = 540 subjects) from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals participating in two longitudinal cohort studies of aging. RESULTS We confirm the association of two well-established miRNA (miR-132, miR-129) with pathologic AD in our dataset and then further characterize this association in terms of its component neuritic $\beta$-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle pathologies. Additionally, we identify one new miRNA (miR-99) and four lincRNA that are associated with these traits. Many other previously reported associations of microRNA with AD are associated with the confounders quantified in our longitudinal cohort. Finally, by performing analyses integrating both miRNA and RNA sequence data from the same individuals (525 samples), we characterize the impact of AD associated miRNA on human brain expression: we show that the effects of miR-132 and miR-129-5b converge on certain genes such as EP300 and find a role for miR200 and its target genes in AD using an integrated miRNA/mRNA analysis. CONCLUSIONS Overall, miRNAs play a modest role in human AD, but we observe robust evidence that a small number of miRNAs are responsible for specific alterations in the cortical transcriptome that are associated with AD.},

abstract = {An overview of miRNAs altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was established by profiling the hippocampus of a cohort of 41 late-onset AD (LOAD) patients and 23 controls, showing deregulation of 35 miRNAs. Profiling of miRNAs in the prefrontal cortex of a second independent cohort of 49 patients grouped by Braak stages revealed 41 deregulated miRNAs. We focused on miR-132-3p which is strongly altered in both brain areas. Downregulation of this miRNA occurs already at Braak stages III and IV, before loss of neuron-specific miRNAs. Next-generation sequencing confirmed a strong decrease of miR-132-3p and of three family-related miRNAs encoded by the same miRNA cluster on chromosome 17. Deregulation of miR-132-3p in AD brain appears to occur mainly in neurons displaying Tau hyper-phosphorylation. We provide evidence that miR-132-3p may contribute to disease progression through aberrant regulation of mRNA targets in the Tau network. The transcription factor (TF) FOXO1a appears to be a key target of miR-132-3p in this pathway.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hematopoietic stress responses involve increases in leukocyte and platelet counts, implying the existence of stress responsive factors that modulate hematopoiesis. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is expressed in mammalian neurons and hematopoietic cells. In brain, it responds to stress by mRNA overexpression and alternative splicing, yielding the rare stress-associated "readthrough" AChE-R variant protein. This led us to explore the hematopoietic involvement of AChE-R and its cleavable C-terminal peptide ARP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AChE mRNA variants were labeled in CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells by in situ hybridization. ARP expression was detected by multicolor flow cytometry. Bromo-deoxyuracil incorporation and viable cell counts served to evaluate the proliferative effects of ARP and suppressive effects of the AChE antisense oligonucleotide AS1 on CD34(+) cells. RESULTS: The distal enhancer, proximal promoter, and first intron of the human AChE gene include consensus binding sites for hematopoietically active and stress-induced transcription factors. CD34(+) cells from human cord blood were found to express all three variant AChE mRNAs, having different intracellular distributions. ARP was found in 5 to 15{\%} of adult peripheral blood, bone marrow, and fetal CD34(+) cells (both committed CD38(+) and uncommitted CD38(-)) and in acute myeloid leukemia blasts. Externally supplied ARP by itself facilitated the proliferation of CD34(+) cells in an antisense suppressible manner. When combined with early-acting cytokines, ARP enhanced survival and expansion of CD34(+) cells up to 28 days in culture. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support ARP, the C-terminal peptide of AChE-R, as a new hematopoietic growth factor that may promote the myelopoietic expansion and thrombopoiesis characteristic of stress and may be used to enhance the efficiency of ex vivo expansion for bone marrow transplantation.},

abstract = {The complete knockout of the acetylcholinesterase gene (AChE) in the mouse yielded a surprising phenotype that could not have been predicted from deletion of the cholinesterase genes in Drosophila, that of a living, but functionally compromised animal. The phenotype of this animal showed a sufficient compromise in motor function that precluded precise characterization of central and peripheral nervous functional deficits. Since AChE in mammals is encoded by a single gene with alternative splicing, additional understanding of gene expression might be garnered from selected deletions of the alternatively spliced exons. To this end, transgenic strains were generated that deleted exon 5, exon 6, and the combination of exons 5 and 6. Deletion of exon 6 reduces brain AChE by 93{\%} and muscle AChE by 72{\%}. Deletion of exon 5 eliminates AChE from red cells and the platelet surface. These strains, as well as knockout strains that selectively eliminate the AChE anchoring protein subunits PRiMA or ColQ (which bind to sequences specified by exon 6) enabled us to examine the role of the alternatively spliced exons responsible for the tissue disposition and function of the enzyme. In addition, a knockout mouse was made with a deletion in an upstream intron that had been identified in differentiating cultures of muscle cells to control AChE expression. We found that deletion of the intronic regulatory region in the mouse essentially eliminated AChE in muscle and surprisingly from the surface of platelets. The studies generated by these knockout mouse strains have yielded valuable insights into the function and localization of AChE in mammalian systems that cannot be approached in cell culture or in vitro.},

Adolescence in particular is a unique period characterized by continued brain maturation, superimposed with transient needs of the organism to traverse a leap from parental dependence to independence. Here we describe how these needs require immune maturation, as well as brain maturation. Our immune system, which protects us from pathogens and regulates inflammation, is in constant communication with our nervous system. Together, neuro-immune signaling regulates our behavioral responses to the environment, making this interaction a likely substrate for adolescent development. We review here the identified as well as understudied components of neuro-immune interactions during adolescence. Synaptic pruning, neurite outgrowth, and neurotransmitter release during adolescence all regulate—and are regulated by—immune signals, which occur via blood-brain barrier dynamics and glial activity. We discuss these processes, as well as how immune signaling during this transitional period of development confers differential effects on behavior and vulnerability to mental illness.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer, are powerful new tools for investigating a wide range of biological and medical questions. Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data. We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection. Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also reveal the need for further research in the development of statistical and computational methods for mRNA-Seq.},

abstract = {The mononuclear phagocytes control the body homeostasis through the involvement in resolving tissue injury and further wound healing. Indeed, local tissue microenvironmental changes can significantly influence the functional behavior of monocytes and macrophages. Such microenvironmental changes for example occur in an atherosclerotic plaque during all progression stages. In response to exogenous stimuli, macrophages show a great phenotypic plasticity and heterogeneity. Exposure of monocytes to inflammatory or anti-inflammatory conditions also induces predominant differentiation to proinflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophage subsets and phenotype switch between macrophage subsets. The phenotype transition is accompanied with great changes in the macrophage transcriptome and regulatory networks. Interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) play a key role in hematopoietic development of monocytes, their differentiation to macrophages, and regulating macrophage maturation, phenotypic polarization, phenotypic switch, and function. Of 9 IRFs, at least 3 (IRF-1, IRF-5, and IRF-8) are involved in the commitment of proinflammatory M1 whereas IRF-3 and IRF-4 control M2 polarization. The role of IRF-2 is context-dependent. The IRF impact on macrophage phenotype plasticity and heterogeneity is complex and involves activating and repressive function in triggering transcription of target genes.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-25-nucleotide-long, noncoding RNAs that are involved in translational regulation. Most miRNAs derive from a two-step sequential processing: the generation of pre-miRNA from pri-miRNA by the Drosha/DGCR8 complex in the nucleus, and the generation of mature miRNAs from pre-miRNAs by the Dicer/TRBP complex in the cytoplasm. Sequence variation around the processing sites, and sequence variations in the mature miRNA, especially the seed sequence, may have profound affects on miRNA biogenesis and function. In the context of analyzing the roles of miRNAs in Schizophrenia and Autism, we defined at least 24 human X-linked miRNA variants. Functional assays were developed and performed on these variants. In this study we investigate the affects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the generation of mature miRNAs and their function, and report that naturally occurring SNPs can impair or enhance miRNA processing as well as alter the sites of processing. Since miRNAs are small functional units, single base changes in both the precursor elements as well as the mature miRNA sequence may drive the evolution of new microRNAs by altering their biological function. Finally, the miRNAs examined in this study are X-linked, suggesting that the mutant alleles could be determinants in the etiology of diseases.},

abstract = {The effects of retinoic acid (RA), a naturally occurring metabolite of vitamin A, on the growth, morphology and neurochemical differentiation of the PC12 clone of rat pheochromocytoma cells were investigated. RA added to the medium inhibited the growth of PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner up to 10 $\mu$M without affecting their morphology. In PC12 cells cultured in the presence of 10 $\mu$M RA for 8 days, the specific activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was increased2-fold, while the specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was decreased 0.5-fold compared with cells cultured in the absence of RA. Specific activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutamate decar☐ylase (GAD) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were not affected by RA. Both the increase of ChAT and the decrease of TH induced by RA exhibited similar time and dose dependencies. RA inhibited the increase of TH activity induced by nerve growth factor (NGF), an adrenergic neuronotrophic factor on PC12 cells. From these observations it was concluded that RA induces a cholinergic neurochemical differentiation of PC12 cells independent of a morphological differentiation.},

abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine with important functions in various physiologic processes. Mice lacking IL-6 exhibit multiple phenotypic abnormalities, such as an inadequate immune and acute-phase response, and elevated levels of circulating IL-6 have been found to accompany several pathological conditions. IL-6 binds the nonsignaling IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), which is expressed as a transmembrane, as well as a secreted circulating protein, before it engages homodimeric gp130 for signaling. Complex formation between IL-6 and the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor gives rise to classic cis signaling, whereas complex formation between IL-6 and the soluble IL-6R results in trans signaling. Here, we report that the endocytic receptor SorLA targets IL-6 and IL-6R. We present evidence that SorLA mediates efficient cellular uptake of both IL-6 and the circulating IL-6R in astrocytes. We further show that SorLA interacts with the membrane-bound IL-6R at the cell surface and thereby downregulates IL-6 cis signaling. Finally, we find that the SorLA ectodomain, released from the cell membrane upon enzymatic cleavage of full-length SorLA, may act as an IL-6 carrier protein that stabilizes IL-6 and its capacity for trans signaling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs of 19 to 25 nt, play important roles in gene regulation in both animals and plants. In the last few years, the oligonucleotide microarray is one high-throughput and robust method for detecting miRNA expression. However, the approach is restricted to detecting the expression of known miRNAs. Second-generation sequencing is an inexpensive and high-throughput sequencing method. This new method is a promising tool with high sensitivity and specificity and can be used to measure the abundance of small-RNA sequences in a sample. Hence, the expression profiling of miRNAs can involve use of sequencing rather than an oligonucleotide array. Additionally, this method can be adopted to discover novel miRNAs. RESULTS: This work presents a systematic approach, miRExpress, for extracting miRNA expression profiles from sequencing reads obtained by second-generation sequencing technology. A stand-alone software package is implemented for generating miRNA expression profiles from high-throughput sequencing of RNA without the need for sequenced genomes. The software is also a database-supported, efficient and flexible tool for investigating miRNA regulation. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of miRExpress in extracting miRNA expression profiles from two Illumina data sets constructed for the human and a plant species. CONCLUSION: We develop miRExpress, which is a database-supported, efficient and flexible tool for detecting miRNA expression profile. The analysis of two Illumina data sets constructed from human and plant demonstrate the effectiveness of miRExpress to obtain miRNA expression profiles and show the usability in finding novel miRNAs.},

abstract = {Vascular integrity helps maintain brain microenvironment homeostasis, which is critical for the normal develop-ment and function of the central nervous system. It is known that neural cells can regulate brain vascular integrity. However, due to the high complexity of neurovascular interactions involved, understanding of the neural regulation of brain vascular integrity is still rudimentary. Using intact zebrafish larvae and cultured rodent brain cells, we find that neurons transfer miR-132, a highly conserved and neuron-enriched microRNA, via secreting exosomes to endothelial cells (ECs) to maintain brain vascular integrity. Following translocation to ECs through exosome inter-nalization, miR-132 regulates the expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), an important adherens junction protein, by directly targeting eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eef2k). Disruption of neuronal miR-132 expression or exosome secretion, or overexpression of vascular eef2k impairs VE-cadherin expression and brain vas-cular integrity. Our study indicates that miR-132 acts as an intercellular signal mediating neural regulation of the brain vascular integrity and suggests that the neuronal exosome is a novel avenue for neurovascular communication.},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence indicate that schizophrenia has a strong genetic component. But the exact nature and functional role of this genetic component in the pathophysiology of this mental illness remains a mystery. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a recently discovered family of molecules that regulate gene transcription through a variety of means. Consequently, lncRNAs could help us bring together apparent unrelated findings in schizophrenia; namely, genomic deficiencies on one side and neuroimaging, as well as postmortem results on the other. In fact, the most consistent finding in schizophrenia is decreased brain size together with enlarged ventricles. This anomaly appears to originate from shorter and less ramified dendrites and axons. But a decrease in neuronal arborizations cannot explain the complex pathophysiology of this psychotic disorder; however, dynamic changes in neuronal structure present throughout life could. It is well recognized that the structure of developing neurons is extremely plastic. This structural plasticity was thought to stop with brain development. However, breakthrough discoveries have shown that neuronal structure retains some degree of plasticity throughout life. What the neuroscientific field is still trying to understand is how these dynamic changes are regulated and lncRNAs represent promising candidates to fill this knowledge gap. Here, we present evidence that associates specific lncRNAs with schizophrenia. We then discuss the potential role of lncRNAs in neurostructural dynamics. Finally, we explain how dynamic neurostructural modifications present throughout life could, in theory, reconcile apparent unrelated findings in schizophrenia.},

Although the drug has a small therapeutic window, its uptake and passage into the brain are poorly understood. We administered lithium to rats, following an acute (3 mmol/kg, i.p.) or chronic (3 mmol/kg/day, p.o.) regime. Lithium levels were assessed in serum, brain homogenate, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and, by means of microdialysis, in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain 2, 6 and 24h post injection or after 3 weeks of chronic administration. Lithium is detected in brain ECS within minutes of administration and reaches maximum levels in brain extracellular fluid after 30 min. In the early phase after lithium administration (2 and 6h), serum levels of lithium do not differ significantly from those assessed in CSF and brain homogenate. Afterwards, however, accumulation in brain tissue occurs. As a consequence, after 24h and 3 weeks, lithium levels in brain homogenate (i.e., intracellular levels) are significantly higher than in CSF or dialysates (i.e., extracellular levels). In conclusion, lithium rapidly reaches the brain, but after prolonged treatment, brain intracellular levels are high and poorly represented by plasma or CSF measurements.},

abstract = {This review has two aims. First, to examine whether or not sex and gender may influence the brain cholinergic system in animals and in humans. Second, to examine the available evidence of sexually dimorphic response to the therapeutic and toxic effects of cholinesterase inhibitors. Animal research reveals no marked difference in the general morphology of the brain cholinergic system but subtle functional gender differences have been reported. In humans, gender differences in nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) exist. In animals, some cholinergic neurons express estrogen alpha receptors in females and androgens in males. It is known that sex hormones exert trophic effects on the cholinergic system. Females show higher frontal cortex cholinergic activity whereas males have higher activity in the hippocampus. Gender differences in the pharmacological effects result in higher sensitivity to the toxic effects of organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitors in males. A stronger and more selective benefit of ChEI treatment in AD has been reported in men by several authors. Sex and estrogen receptor phenotype may both influence the response to donepezil and rivastigmine. Hence, aged male and female individuals might respond differently to ChEI due to either sex-specific differences in structures and function of the cholinergic system, pharmacokinetics, memory function or in the way aging or AD affects these processes.},

@article{Encinas2000,
abstract = {A rapid and simple procedure is presented to obtain nearly pure populations of human neuron-like cells from the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Sequential exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to retinoic acid and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in serum-free medium yields homogeneous populations of cells with neuronal morphology, avoiding the presence of other neural crest derivatives that would normally arise from those cells. Cells are withdrawn from the cell cycle, as shown by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine uptake and retinoblastoma hypophosphorylation. Cell survival is dependent on the continuous presence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and removal of this neurotrophin causes apoptotic cell death accompanied by an attempt to reenter the cell cycle. Differentiated cells express neuronal markers, including neurofilaments, neuron-specific enolase, and growth-associated protein-43 as well as neuronal polarity markers such as tau and microtubule-associated protein 2. Moreover, differentiated cultures do not contain glial cells, as could be evidenced after the negative staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein. In conclusion, the protocol presented herein yields homogeneous populations of human neuronal differentiated cells that present many of the characteristics of primary cultures of neurons. This model may be useful to perform large-scale biochemical and molecular studies due to its susceptibility to genetic manipulation and the availability of an unlimited amount of cells.},

To this end, we present a provisional list of 50 commonly used terms in psychology, psychiatry, and allied fields that should be avoided, or at most used sparingly and with explicit caveats. We provide corrective information for students, instructors, and researchers regarding these terms, which we organize for expository purposes into five categories: inaccurate or misleading terms, frequently misused terms, ambiguous terms, oxymorons, and pleonasms. For each term, we (a) explain why it is problematic, (b) delineate one or more examples of its misuse, and (c) when pertinent, offer recommendations for preferable terms. By being more judicious in their use of terminology, psychologists and psychiatrists can foster clearer thinking in their students and the field at large regarding mental phenomena.},

abstract = {IL-22 has both proinflammatory and tissue-protective properties depending on the context in which it is expressed. However, the factors that influence the functional outcomes of IL-22 expression remain poorly defined. We demonstrate that after administration of a high dose of bleomycin that induces acute tissue damage and airway inflammation and is lethal to wild-type (WT) mice, Th17 cell–derived IL-22 and IL-17A are expressed in the lung. Bleomycin-induced disease was ameliorated in Il22−/− mice or after anti–IL-22 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment of WT mice, indicating a proinflammatory/pathological role for IL-22 in airway inflammation. However, despite increased bleomycin-induced IL-22 production, Il17a−/− mice were protected from airway inflammation, suggesting that IL-17A may regulate the expression and/or proinflammatory properties of IL-22. Consistent with this, IL-17A inhibited IL-22 production by Th17 cells, and exogenous administration of IL-22 could only promote airway inflammation in vivo by acting in synergy with IL-17A. Anti–IL-22 mAb was delivered to Il17a−/− mice and was found to exacerbate bleomycin-induced airway inflammation, indicating that IL-22 is tissue protective in the absence of IL-17A. Finally, in an in vitro culture system, IL-22 administration protected airway epithelial cells from bleomycin-induced apoptosis, and this protection was reversed after coadministration of IL-17A. These data identify that IL-17A can regulate the expression, proinflammatory properties, and tissue-protective functions of IL-22, and indicate that the presence or absence of IL-17A governs the proinflammatory versus tissue-protective properties of IL-22 in a model of airway damage and inflammation.},

abstract = {An impaired central cholinergic system is at least partly involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, with cholinergic markers such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and protein levels decreasing as cognitive decline progresses. AD patients receive AChE inhibitor drugs to enhance cholinergic responses in the brain. The present study characterises the cholinergic system of mice heterozygous for AChE (HZ) as a suitable in vivo model for permanently reduced AChE activity. In comparison to homozygous, wild type (WT) mice, HZ mice show a 40{\%} reduction of AChE activity in the brain, while their hippocampal ACh levels are increased by 56{\%} as measured by microdialysis; choline acetyltransferase levels remain unaltered, and choline uptake increases 2-fold. We demonstrate that HZ mice are significantly more sensitive to local AChE inhibition (BW284c51), but remain insensitive to butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibition (bambuterol). HZ mice are also more sensitive to the peripheral application of the selective AChE inhibitor donepezil or the mixed inhibitor physostigmine; extracellular ACh levels rise significantly after administration of both drugs; also glucose levels are moderately increased indicating potentially non-cholinergic effects of donepezil. Behavioural tests show comparable cognitive function in both mouse strains. Our results are discussed in relation to the use of AChE/BuChE inhibitors in AD patients.},

abstract = {B cells are essential components of the adaptive immune system and have important roles in the pathogenesis of several central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Besides producing antibodies, B cells perform other functions, including antigen presentation to T cells, production of proinflammatory cytokines and secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines that limit immune responses. B cells can contribute to CNS disease either through their actions in the periphery (meaning that they have an 'outside-in' effect on CNS immunopathology) or following their compartmentalization within the CNS. The success of B cell-depleting therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis and CNS diseases with an autoantibody component, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and autoimmune encephalitides, has underscored the role of B cells in both cellular and humoral-mediated CNS conditions. Emerging evidence suggests B cells also contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. Advancing our understanding of the role of B cells in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases could lead to novel therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) within mRNA sequences of Alzheimer's disease genes, namely, APP, APOE, PSEN1, and PSEN2, has been analyzed using fractal dimension (FD) computation and correlation analysis. We examined lncRNA by comparing mRNA FD to corresponding coding DNA sequences (CDSs) FD. APP, APOE, and PSEN1 CDSs select slightly higher FDs compared to the mRNA, while PSEN2 CDSs FDs are lower. The correlation coefficient for these sequences is 0.969. A comparative study of differentially expressed MAPK signaling pathway lncRNAs in pancreatic cancer cells shows a correlation of 0.771. Selection of higher FD CDSs could indicate interaction of Alzheimer's gene products APP, APOE, and PSEN1. Including hypocretin sequences (where all CDSs have higher fractal dimensions than mRNA) in the APP, APOE, and PSEN1 sequence analyses improves correlation, but the inclusion of erythropoietin (where all CDSs have higher FD than mRNA) would suppress correlation, suggesting that HCRT, a hypothalamus neurotransmitter related to the wake/sleep cycle, might be better when compared to EPO, a glycoprotein hormone, for targeting Alzheimer's disease drug development. Fractal dimension and entropy correlation have provided supporting evidence, consistent with evolutionary studies, for using a zebrafish model together with a mouse model, in HCRT drug development.},

abstract = {Cognitive symptoms play a central role in schizophrenia and are strongly associated with social functioning. Treatment with clozapine presents controversial results regarding its effects on cognition. The opposite effects of clozapine and n-desmethylclozapine (NDMC) on cholinergic system have been suggested to underlie these inconclusive findings. The aim of this study is to determine whether clozapine/NDMC ratio can predict cognitive performance in patients with treatment-resistant psychosis. Nineteen clinically stable patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with clozapine monotherapy completed demographic and clinical interviews. For the purpose of the study, patients were assessed with a neuropsychological battery and on the same day a blood sampling was obtained from each patient to measure plasma levels of clozapine and NDMC. Our results showed that clozapine/NDMC ratio, but not clozapine or NDMC plasma levels separately, was a predictive factor of cognitive performance, specifically of executive functioning. Our results showed that lower clozapine/NDMC ratios are associated with better executive functioning in clinically stable patients. These findings could be interpreted by the different pharmacodynamic properties on cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic systems of NDMC compared to clozapine.},

abstract = {Several findings obtained in recent years suggest that NGF, aside from its well-established function as a neurotrophic factor for peripheral sympathetic and sensory neurons, also has trophic influence on the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. The present study assessed whether NGF was able to affect survival of central cholinergic neurons after axonal transections in adult rats. The septo-hippocampal pathway was transected unilaterally by cutting the fimbria, and animals were implanted with a cannula through which NGF or control solutions were injected intraventricularly over 4 weeks. The lesions reduced the number of large cell bodies, as visualized by Nissl staining in the medial septal nucleus and in the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca. Furthermore, in the same nuclei, they reduced the number of cell bodies positively stained for AChE after pretreatment with diisopropylfluorophosphate (a method known to result in reliable identification of cholinergic neurons in the septal area). On lesioned sides, the number of cholinergic cells in medial septal nucleus and the vertical limb of the diagonal band was reduced by 50 +/- 4{\%}, as compared to the number on contralateral sides. On lesioned sides of animals chronically treated with NGF, the number of AChE-positive cells in these areas was reduced only by 12 +/- 6{\%}, as compared to control levels. These findings suggest that fimbrial transections resulted in retrograde degeneration of cholinergic septo-hippocampal neurons and that NGF treatment strongly attenuated this lesion-induced degeneration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Protein translation has been implicated in different forms of synaptic plasticity, but direct in situ visualization of new proteins is limited to one or two proteins at a time. Here we describe a metabolic labeling approach based on incorporation of noncanonical amino acids into proteins followed by chemoselective fluorescence tagging by means of 'click chemistry'. After a brief incubation with azidohomoalanine or homopropargylglycine, a robust fluorescent signal was detected in somata and dendrites. Pulse-chase application of azidohomoalanine and homopropargylglycine allowed visualization of proteins synthesized in two sequential time periods. This technique can be used to detect changes in protein synthesis and to evaluate the fate of proteins synthesized in different cellular compartments. Moreover, using strain-promoted cycloaddition, we explored the dynamics of newly synthesized membrane proteins using single-particle tracking and quantum dots. The newly synthesized proteins showed a broad range of diffusive behaviors, as would be expected for a pool of labeled proteins that is heterogeneous.},

abstract = {Continuously cultured human neuroblastoma cell lines SK-N-SH, SK-N-BE(1), SK-N-BE(2), and SK-N-MC, as well as several clonally derived sublines, were assessed for their neurotransmitter characteristics. Two different methods were used: measurement of cholinergic and adrenergic enzyme activities and detection of neurotransmitters synthesized from radioactive precursors. Dopamine-{\{}beta{\}}-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.2.1), choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6), acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7), and butyrylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8) levels were compared to those of various normal and neuronal cell controls. The capacity of neuroblastoma lines and clones to convert radioactive tyrosine, choline, and glutamate to transmitter products was determined. SK-N-SH, SK-N-BE(1), and SK-N-BE(2) cells had moderately high levels of dopamine-{\{}beta{\}}-hydroxylase activity. Whereas neuroblast-like clones of SK-N-SH had similar levels of this enzyme, epithelial-like clones had no detectable activity. SK-N-BE(2) cells showed the greatest capacity to convert tyrosine to dopamine. Although the SK-N-SH line itself was not tested, both neuroblast and epithelial-like clones, shown by karyotype analysis to have a common cell precursor, converted tyrosine to dopamine. In contrast, the SK-N-MC line and its clones appeared devoid of adrenergic properties. All cells tested except human fibroblast-like cells of normal origin were able to convert radioactive choline to acetylcholine. While all the cell lines had measurable choline acetyltransferase activity, levels were substantially higher (at least 4- to 12-fold) for SK-N-MC cells and its clonally derived subline MC-IXC. All cells tested converted glutamate to {\{}gamma{\}}-aminobutyric acid. Results indicate that these human neuroblastoma cell lines have predominating neurotransmitter characteristics that are sometimes, but not always, expressed in clones derived from them. Since the SK-N-BE(1) and SK-N-BE(2) lines were isolated 5 months apart from the same patient and have similar activity levels of dopamine-{\{}beta{\}}-hydroxylase, these characteristics may be stable and representative of the tumor cells in vivo. Furthermore, results obtained by the two different methodological approaches suggest that, whereas SK-N-MC cells show cholinergic and not adrenergic traits, SK-N-SH and possibly SK-N-BE(2) may be multipotential with regard to neuronal enzyme expression.},

Recent studies have shown that the expression of many miRNAs is altered in various human tumors and some miRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. However, with the exception of glioblastoma multiforme, the expression of miRNAs in brain tumors is unknown. Furthermore, methods to profile miRNAs from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tissues or to study their cellular and subcellular localization in FFPE tissues have been lacking. Here we report the coordinated miRNA expression analysis from the tissue level to the subcellular level, using the RAKE (RNA-primed, array-based, Klenow Enzyme) miRNA microarray platform in conjunction with Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA)-based in situ hybridization (LNA-ISH) on archival FFPE human brains and oligodendroglial tumors. The ability to profile miRNAs from archival tissues at the tissue level, by RAKE microarrays, and at the cellular level by LNA-ISH, will accelerate studies of miRNAs in human diseases.},

Parkinson's-disease (PD) is the most frequent motor disorder, and Deep-brain-stimulation (DBS) treatment alleviates the symptoms, but early disease biomarkers are still unknown and new future genetic interference targets are urgently needed. Using RNA-sequencing technology and a novel computational workflow for in-depth exploration of whole-transcriptome RNA-seq datasets, we detected and analyzed lncRNAs in sequenced libraries from PD patients' leukocytes pre and post-treatment and the brain, adding this full profile resource of over 7,000 lncRNAs to the few human tissues-derived lncRNA datasets that are currently available. Our study includes sample-specific database construction, detecting disease-derived changes in known and novel lncRNAs, exons and junctions and predicting corresponding changes in Polyadenylation choices, protein domains and miRNA binding sites. We report widespread transcript structure variations at the splice junction and exons levels, including novel exons and junctions and alteration of lncRNAs followed by experimental validation in PD leukocytes and two PD brain regions compared with controls. Our results suggest lncRNAs involvement in neurodegenerative diseases, and specifically PD.

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves changes in both lipid and RNA metabolism, but it remained unknown if these differences associate with AD's cognition and/or post-mortem neuropathology indices. Here, we report RNA-sequencing evidence of inter-related associations between lipid processing, cognition level, and AD neuropathology. In two unrelated cohorts, we identified pathway-enriched facilitation of lipid processing and alternative splicing genes, including the neuronal-enriched NOVA1 and hnRNPA1. Specifically, this association emerged in temporal lobe tissue samples from donors where postmortem evidence demonstrated AD neuropathology, but who presented normal cognition proximate to death. The observed changes further associated with modified ATP synthesis and mitochondrial transcripts, indicating metabolic relevance; accordingly, mass-spectrometry-derived lipidomic profiles distinguished between individuals with and without cognitive impairment prior to death. In spite of the limited group sizes, tissues from persons with both cognitive impairment and AD pathology showed elevation in several drug-targeted genes of other brain, vascular and autoimmune disorders, accompanied by pathology-related increases in distinct lipid processing transcripts, and in the RNA metabolism genes hnRNPH2, TARDBP, CLP1 and EWSR1. To further detect 3′-polyadenylation variants, we employed multiple cDNA primer pairs. This identified variants that showed limited differences in scope and length between the tested cohorts, yet enabled superior clustering of demented and non-demented AD brains versus controls compared to total mRNA expression values. Our findings indicate inter-related cognition-associated differences in AD's lipid processing, alternative splicing and 3′-polyadenylation, calling for pursuing the underlying psychological and therapeutics implications.},

@article{DeSimone2005,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nicotinic acetylcholine (Ach) receptors are ligand-gated pentameric ion channels whose main function is to transmit signals for the neurotransmitter Ach in peripheral and central nervous system. However, the alpha7 nicotinic receptor has been recently found in several non-neuronal cells and described as an important regulator of cellular function. Nicotine and ACh have been recently reported to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production in human macrophages as well as in mouse microglial cultures. In the present study, we investigated whether the stimulation of alpha7 nicotinic receptor by the specific agonist nicotine could affect the functional state of activated microglia by promoting and/or inhibiting the release of other important pro-inflammatory and lipid mediator such as prostaglandin E2. METHODS: Expression of alpha7 nicotinic receptor in rat microglial cell was examined by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. The functional effects of alpha7 receptor activation were analyzed in resting or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated microglial cells pre-treated with nicotine. Culture media were assayed for the levels of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1beta, nitric oxide, interleukin-10 and prostaglandin E2. Total RNA was assayed by RT-PCR for the expression of COX-2 mRNA. RESULTS: Rat microglial cells express alpha7 nicotinic receptor, and its activation by nicotine dose-dependently reduces the LPS-induced release of TNF-alpha, but has little or no effect on nitric oxide, interleukin-10 and interleukin-1beta. By contrast, nicotine enhances the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and the synthesis of one of its major products, prostaglandin E2. CONCLUSIONS: Since prostaglandin E2 modulates several macrophage and lymphocyte functions, which are instrumental for inflammatory resolution, our study further supports the existence of a brain cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway mediated by alpha7 nicotinic receptor that could be potentially exploited for novel treatments of several neuropathologies in which local inflammation, sustained by activated microglia, plays a crucial role.},

Here, we report the identification of 244 miRs that target the 3textquoteright-untranslated regions of different cholinesterase transcripts: 116 for butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), 47 for the synaptic acetylcholinesterase (AChE-S) splice variant, and 81 for the normally rare splice variant AChE-R. Of these, 11 and 6 miRs target both AChE-S and AChE-R, and AChE-R and BChE transcripts, respectively. BChE and AChE-S showed no overlapping miRs, attesting to their distinct modes of miR regulation. Generally, miRs can suppress a number of targets; thereby controlling an entire battery of functions. To evaluate the importance of the cholinesterase-targeted miRs in other specific biological processes we searched for their other experimentally validated target transcripts and analyzed the gene ontology enriched biological processes these transcripts are involved in. Interestingly, a number of the resulting categories are also related to cholinesterases. They include, for BChE, response to glucocorticoid stimulus, and for AChE, response to wounding and two child terms of neuron development: regulation of axonogenesis and regulation of dendrite morphogenesis. Importantly, all of the AChE-targeting miRs found to be related to these selected processes were directed against the normally rare AChE-R splice variant, with three of them, including the neurogenesis regulator miR-132, also directed against AChE-S. Our findings point at the AChE-R splice variant as particularly susceptible to miR regulation, highlight those biological functions of cholinesterases that are likely to be subject to miR post-transcriptional control, demonstrate the selectivity of miRs in regulating specific biological processes, and open new venues for targeted interference with these specific processes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Genomic datasets generated by new technologies are increasingly prevalent in disparate areas of biological research. While many studies have sought to characterize relationships among genomic features, commensurate efforts to characterize relationships among biological samples have been less common. Consequently, the full extent of sample variation in genomic studies is often under-appreciated, complicating downstream analytical tasks such as gene co-expression network analysis. RESULTS Here we demonstrate the use of network methods for characterizing sample relationships in microarray data generated from human brain tissue. We describe an approach for identifying outlying samples that does not depend on the choice or use of clustering algorithms. We introduce a battery of measures for quantifying the consistency and integrity of sample relationships, which can be compared across disparate studies, technology platforms, and biological systems. Among these measures, we provide evidence that the correlation between the connectivity and the clustering coefficient (two important network concepts) is a sensitive indicator of homogeneity among biological samples. We also show that this measure, which we refer to as cor(K,C), can distinguish biologically meaningful relationships among subgroups of samples. Specifically, we find that cor(K,C) reveals the profound effect of Huntington's disease on samples from the caudate nucleus relative to other brain regions. Furthermore, we find that this effect is concentrated in specific modules of genes that are naturally co-expressed in human caudate nucleus, highlighting a new strategy for exploring the effects of disease on sets of genes. CONCLUSIONS These results underscore the importance of systematically exploring sample relationships in large genomic datasets before seeking to analyze genomic feature activity. We introduce a standardized platform for this purpose using freely available R software that has been designed to enable iterative and interactive exploration of sample networks.},

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

abstract = {The immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin6 (IL6) acts in a pro- and anti-inflammatory fashion. Synthesized by myeloid cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells, IL6 on target cells, binds to the IL6 receptor (IL6R) and signals via complex formation with the ubiquitously expressed gp130 receptor. Paradoxically, most cells that respond to IL6 during inflammatory states do not express the IL6R and are themselves not directly responsive to the cytokine. A naturally occurring soluble form of the IL6R renders all cells responsive to IL6. This alternative signaling process is called IL6 transsignaling. Here we developed a transgenic strategy based on the overexpression of the soluble form of gp130, which specifically blocks all IL6 responses mediated by the soluble IL6R but does not affect IL6 responses via the membrane bound IL6R. In these mice, inflammatory processes are blocked as in IL6−/− mice, strongly arguing for a major role of the soluble IL6R during inflammation in vivo.},

Parkinson's-disease (PD) is the most frequent motor disorder, and Deep-brain-stimulation (DBS) treatment alleviates the symptoms, but early disease biomarkers are still unknown and new future genetic interference targets are urgently needed. Using RNA-sequencing technology and a novel computational workflow for in-depth exploration of whole-transcriptome RNA-seq datasets, we detected and analyzed lncRNAs in sequenced libraries from PD patients' leukocytes pre and post-treatment and the brain, adding this full profile resource of over 7,000 lncRNAs to the few human tissues-derived lncRNA datasets that are currently available. Our study includes sample-specific database construction, detecting disease-derived changes in known and novel lncRNAs, exons and junctions and predicting corresponding changes in Polyadenylation choices, protein domains and miRNA binding sites. We report widespread transcript structure variations at the splice junction and exons levels, including novel exons and junctions and alteration of lncRNAs followed by experimental validation in PD leukocytes and two PD brain regions compared with controls. Our results suggest lncRNAs involvement in neurodegenerative diseases, and specifically PD. This comprehensive workflow will be of use to the increasing number of laboratories producing RNA-Seq data in a wide range of biomedical studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Retinoic acid (RA), a natural metabolite of vitamin A, influences the survival and neurotransmitter phenotype of several classes of vertebrate neurons during development. We now report that RA induces a subpopulation of NTera 2/clone D1 (NT2) human embryonal carcinoma cells to differentiate into postmitotic cells with cholinergic properties (NT2-N cells). After growth for 6 days in the presence of RA (10 microM) low levels of the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were detected in NT2 cell cultures. ChAT activity in the NT2 cell cultures continued to increase for at least an additional 22 days to a final activity of 50 pmol ACh synthesized/min/mg protein. Immunohistochemical staining of RA-treated cultures demonstrated that only those cells with a neuronal morphology (NT2-N cells) expressed the human ChAT protein. Since such cells comprised a small proportion (approximately 20{\%}) of the population, the ChAT activity per neuronal cell was estimated to approach 250-300 pmol ACh/min/mg protein. Cultures composed of {\textgreater} 95{\%} NT2-N cells had significantly lower ChAT specific activities and this could be increased by either ciliary neurotrophic factor or leukemia inhibitory factor, but not by nerve growth factor. We conclude that NT2 cells provide a system in which to study the molecular events that underlie neurotransmitter choice during the differentiation of human cholinergic neurons.},

To explore the mechanism of non-coding regulatory elements in schizophrenia, we performed ATAC-seq on adult prefrontal cortex brain samples from 135 individuals with schizophrenia and 137 controls, and identified 118,152 ATAC-seq peaks. These accessible chromatin regions in the brain are highly enriched for schizophrenia SNP heritability. Accessible chromatin regions that overlap evolutionarily conserved regions exhibit an even higher heritability enrichment, indicating that sequence conservation can further refine functional risk variants. We identify few differences in chromatin accessibility between cases and controls, in contrast to thousands of age-related differential accessible chromatin regions. Altogether, we characterize chromatin accessibility in the human prefrontal cortex, the effect of schizophrenia and age on chromatin accessibility, and provide evidence that our dataset will allow for fine mapping of risk variants.},

abstract = {Sex is often overlooked in animal and human research. Cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) remains an unmet clinical need, as current antipsychotic medication does not provide clinically meaningful improvements. One explanation could be lack of appreciation of gender differences in CIAS. Animal models play a critical role in drug development and improved translation to the clinic is an on-going process. Our systematic review aims to evaluate how well the animal studies translate into clinical findings. Supporting clinical results, our review highlights a male working memory advantage and a female advantage for visual memory and social cognition in rodent models for schizophrenia. Not investigated in animals, a female advantage for attention and speed of processing has been found in schizophrenia patients. Sex differences in reasoning and problem solving are poorly investigated in both human and animal studies. Overall, our review provides evidence of good translation from the animal models into the clinic when sexual dimorphism is assessed. Enhanced understanding of these sex differences will improve the management of CIAS.},

abstract = {The proper formation and function of neuronal networks is required for cognition and behavior. Indeed, pathophysiological states that disrupt neuronal networks can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, schizophrenia or intellectual disability. It is well-established that transcriptional programs play major roles in neural circuit development. However, in recent years, post-transcriptional control of gene expression has emerged as an additional, and probably equally important, regulatory layer. In particular, it has been shown that microRNAs (miRNAs), an abundant class of small regulatory RNAs, can regulate neuronal circuit development, maturation and function by controlling, for example, local mRNA translation. It is also becoming clear that miRNAs are frequently dysregulated in neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting a role for miRNAs in the etiology and/or maintenance of neurological disease states. Here, we provide an overview of the most prominent regulatory miRNAs that control neural development, highlighting how they act as 'master regulators' or 'fine-tuners' of gene expression, depending on context, to influence processes such as cell fate determination, cell migration, neuronal polarization and synapse formation.},

abstract = {The diversity and complexity of the human brain are widely assumed to be encoded within a constant genome. Somatic gene recombination, which changes germline DNA sequences to increase molecular diversity, could theoretically alter this code but has not been documented in the brain, to our knowledge. Here we describe recombination of the Alzheimer's disease-related gene APP, which encodes amyloid precursor protein, in human neurons, occurring mosaically as thousands of variant ‘genomic cDNAs' (gencDNAs). gencDNAs lacked introns and ranged from full-length cDNA copies of expressed, brain-specific RNA splice variants to myriad smaller forms that contained intra-exonic junctions, insertions, deletions, and/or single nucleotide variations. DNA in situ hybridization identified gencDNAs within single neurons that were distinct from wild-type loci and absent from non-neuronal cells. Mechanistic studies supported neuronal ‘retro-insertion' of RNA to produce gencDNAs; this process involved transcription, DNA breaks, reverse transcriptase activity, and age. Neurons from individuals with sporadic Alzheimer's disease showed increased gencDNA diversity, including eleven mutations known to be associated with familial Alzheimer's disease that were absent from healthy neurons. Neuronal gene recombination may allow ‘recording' of neural activity for selective ‘playback' of preferred gene variants whose expression bypasses splicing; this has implications for cellular diversity, learning and memory, plasticity, and diseases of the human brain.},

In this Review, Heppner, Ransohoff and Becher examine the contribution of the immune system to the pathogenesis of this disorder. The past two decades of research into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) have been driven largely by the amyloid hypothesis; the neuroinflammation that is associated with AD has been assumed to be merely a response to pathophysiological events. However, new data from preclinical and clinical studies have established that immune system-mediated actions in fact contribute to and drive AD pathogenesis. These insights have suggested both novel and well-defined potential therapeutic targets for AD, including microglia and several cytokines. In addition, as inflammation in AD primarily concerns the innate immune system — unlike in 'typical' neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis and encephalitides — the concept of neuroinflammation in AD may need refinement.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter used by cholinergic neurons at the neuromuscular junction, in parasympathetic peripheral nerve terminals, and in important memory-related circuits in the brain, and takes part in other critical functions. ACh is synthesized from choline and acetyl coenzyme A by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). The formation of ACh in cholinergic nerve terminals requires the transport of choline into cells from the extracellular space and the activity of ChAT. High-affinity choline uptake (HACU) represents the majority of choline uptake into the nerve terminal and is the acutely regulated, rate-limiting step in ACh synthesis. HACU can be differentiated from nonspecific choline uptake by inhibition of the choline transporter with hemicholinium. Several methods have been described previously to measure HACU and ChAT activity simultaneously in synaptosomes, but a well-documented protocol for cultured cells is lacking. We describe a procedure for simultaneous measurement of HACU and ChAT in cultured cells by simple radionuclide-based techniques. Using this procedure, we have quantitatively determined HACU and ChAT activity in cholinergically differentiated human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) cells. These simple methods can be used for neurochemical and drug discovery studies relevant to several disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, myasthenia gravis, and cardiovascular disease.},

@article{Dantzer2018,
abstract = {Because of the compartmentalization of disciplines that shaped the academic landscape of biology and biomedical sciences in the past, physiological systems have long been studied in isolation from each other. This has particularly been the case for the immune system. As a consequence of its ties with pathology and microbiology, immunology as a discipline has largely grown independently of physiology. Accordingly, it has taken a long time for immunologists to accept the concept that the immune system is not self-regulated but functions in close association with the nervous system. These associations are present at different levels of organization. At the local level, there is clear evidence for the production and use of immune factors by the central nervous system and for the production and use of neuroendocrine mediators by the immune system. Short-range interactions between immune cells and peripheral nerve endings innervating immune organs allow the immune system to recruit local neuronal elements for fine tuning of the immune response. Reciprocally, immune cells and mediators play a regulatory role in the nervous system and participate in the elimination and plasticity of synapses during development as well as in synaptic plasticity at adulthood. At the whole organism level, long-range interactions between immune cells and the central nervous system allow the immune system to engage the rest of the body in the fight against infection from pathogenic microorganisms and permit the nervous system to regulate immune functioning. Alterations in communication pathways between the immune system and the nervous system can account for many pathological conditions that were initially attributed to strict organ dysfunction. This applies in particular to psychiatric disorders and several immune-mediated diseases. This review will show how our understanding of this balance between long-range and short-range interactions between the immune system and the central nervous system has evolved over time, since the first demonstrations of immune influences on brain functions. The necessary complementarity of these two modes of communication will then be discussed. Finally, a few examples will illustrate how dysfunction in these communication pathways results in what was formerly considered in psychiatry and immunology to be strict organ pathologies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND For RNA-seq data, the aggregated counts of the short reads from the same gene is used to approximate the gene expression level. The count data can be modelled as samples from Poisson distributions with possible different parameters. To detect differentially expressed genes under two situations, statistical methods for detecting the difference of two Poisson means are used. When the expression level of a gene is low, i.e., the number of count is small, it is usually more difficult to detect the mean differences, and therefore statistical methods which are more powerful for low expression level are particularly desirable. In statistical literature, several methods have been proposed to compare two Poisson means (rates). In this paper, we compare these methods by using simulated and real RNA-seq data. RESULTS Through simulation study and real data analysis, we find that the Wald test with the data being log-transformed is more powerful than other methods, including the likelihood ratio test, which has similar power as the variance stabilizing transformation test; both are more powerful than the conditional exact test and Fisher exact test. CONCLUSIONS When the count data in RNA-seq can be reasonably modelled as Poisson distribution, the Wald-Log test is more powerful and should be used to detect the differentially expressed genes.},

abstract = {Structural changes at synapses are thought to be a key mechanism for the encoding of memories in the brain. Recent studies have shown that changes in the dynamic behavior of dendritic spines accompany bidirectional changes in synaptic plasticity, and that the disruption of structural constraints at synapses may play a mechanistic role in spine plasticity. While the prolonged disruption of N-cadherin, a key synaptic adhesion molecule, has been shown to alter spine morphology, little is known about the short-term regulation of spine morphological dynamics by N-cadherin. With time-lapse, confocal imaging in cultured hippocampal neurons, we examined the progression of structural changes in spines following an acute treatment with AHAVD, a peptide known to interfere with the function of N-cadherin. We characterized fast and slow timescale spine dynamics (minutes and hours, respectively) in the same population of spines. We show that N-cadherin disruption leads to enhanced spine motility and reduced length, followed by spine loss. The structural effects are accompanied by a loss of functional connectivity. Further, we demonstrate that early structural changes induced by AHAVD treatment, namely enhanced motility and reduced length, are indicators for later spine fate, i.e., spines with the former changes are more likely to be subsequently lost. Our results thus reveal the short-term regulation of synaptic structure by N-cadherin and suggest that some forms of morphological dynamics may be potential readouts for subsequent, stimulus-induced rewiring in neuronal networks.},

To examine the molecular mechanisms responsible for aberrant splicing of the tau gene containing mutations linked to FTDP-17, we performed Exon trapping and binding assay using tau exon 10 pre-mRNA and nuclear extracts of neuroblastoma cell lines and in vitro splicing using dsx-substrate. We determined that 5' site of tau exon 10 (nucleotides 12-45) possesses exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) activities in vitro splicing and the FTDP-17-linked mutations affect the ESE activities and alter the splicing patterns of tau exon 10. Tra2 beta directly and ASF/SF2 indirectly associated with the ESE of wild tau exon 10. The binding amounts of these SR proteins to tau exon 10 bearing N279K mutation increased and they enhanced splicing the mutant tau exon 10. SRp30c also enhanced the splicing of tau exon 10.

abstract = {The most prominent feature of the Basal Forebrain (BF) is the collection of large cortically projecting neurons (basal nucleus of Meynert) that serve as the primary source of cholinergic input to the entire cortical mantle. Despite its broad involvement in cortical activation, attention, and memory, the functional details of the BF are not well understood due to the anatomical complexity of the region. This study tested the hypothesis that basalocortical connections reflect cortical connectivity patterns. Distinct retrograde tracers were deposited into various frontal and posterior cortical areas, and retrogradely labeled cholinergic and noncholinergic neurons were mapped in the BF. Concurrently, we mapped retrogradely labeled cells in posterior cortical areas that project to various frontal areas, and all cell populations were combined in the same coordinate system. Our studies suggest that the cholinergic and noncholinergic projections to the neocortex are not diffuse, but instead, are organized into segregated or overlapping pools of projection neurons. The extent of overlap between BF populations projecting to the cortex depends on the degree of connectivity between the cortical targets of these projection populations. We suggest that the organization of projections from the BF may enable parallel modulation of multiple groupings of interconnected yet nonadjacent cortical areas.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) can be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) via association and subsequent degradation. Each miRNA is now believed to potentially have hundreds of target mRNAs. Employing a generic kinetic model with physically reasonable parameters, we have quantified the mutual influence of miRNA and mRNAs in the case when the number of target mRNAs is large (e.g., 100). The decrease in the population of mRNAs due to interaction with miRNA is found to be appreciable (about 1.5-2-fold) only if the rate of the miRNA synthesis is very high. In the absence of the miRNA-mRNA interaction, it should be sufficient to maintain the miRNA population in the order of 104 per cell. In addition, the average mRNA population should not be too high (lower than or comparable to 100 for each kind of mRNA). For lower miRNA synthesis rates, the significant influence of miRNA on mRNAs is only possible provided that the average mRNA population is very low (of the order of 10). These general findings are complemented by a brief discussion of some relevant recent experimental results. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules, with essential functions in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. miRNAs appear to regulate the development and function of the nervous system. Alterations of miRNA expression have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). To characterize the AD miRNA signature, we examined genome-wide miRNA and mRNA expression patterns in the temporal cortex of AD and control samples. We validated our miRNA results by semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in independent prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, we separated gray and white matter brain sections to identify the cellular origin of the altered miRNA expression. We observed genome-wide downregulation of hsa-miR-132-3p and hsa-miR-212-3p in AD with a stronger decrease in gray matter AD samples. We further identified 10 differently expressed transcripts achieving genome-wide levels of significance. Significantly deregulated miRNAs and mRNAs were correlated and examined for potential binding sites (in silico). This miRNome-wide study in AD provides supportive evidence and corroborates an important contribution of miR-132/212 and corresponding target mRNAs to the pathogenesis of AD.},

abstract = {Genomic alignment of small RNA (smRNA) sequences such as microRNAs poses considerable challenges due to their short length (∼21 nucleotides [nt]) as well as the large size and complexity of plant and animal genomes. While several tools have been developed for high-throughput mapping of longer mRNA-seq reads ({\textgreater}30 nt), there are few that are specifically designed for mapping of smRNA reads including microRNAs. The accuracy of these mappers has not been systematically determined in the case of smRNA-seq. In addition, it is unknown whether these aligners accurately map smRNA reads containing sequence errors and polymorphisms. By using simulated read sets, we determine the alignment sensitivity and accuracy of 16 short-read mappers and quantify their robustness to mismatches, indels, and nontemplated nucleotide additions. These were explored in the context of a plant genome (Oryza sativa, ∼500 Mbp) and a mammalian genome (Homo sapiens, ∼3.1 Gbp). Analysis of simulated and real smRNA-seq data demonstrates that mapper selection impacts differential expression results and interpretation. These results will inform on best practice for smRNA mapping and enable more accurate smRNA detection and quantification of expression and RNA editing.},

abstract = {Proteasome-mediated proteolysis is important for synaptic plasticity, neuronal development, protein quality control, and many other processes in neurons. To define proteasome composition in brain, we affinity purified 26S proteasomes from cytosolic and synaptic compartments of the rat cortex. Using tandem mass spectrometry, we identified the standard 26S subunits and a set of 28 proteasome-interacting proteins that associated substoichiometrically and may serve as regulators or cofactors. This set differed from those in other tissues and we also found several proteins that associated only with either the cytosolic or the synaptic proteasome. The latter included the ubiquitin-binding factor TAX1BP1 and synaptic vesicle protein SNAP-25. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a higher proportion of doubly-capped 26S proteasome (19S-20S-19S) in the cortex than in the liver or kidney. To investigate the interplay between proteasome regulation and synaptic plasticity, we exposed cultured neurons to glutamate receptor agonist NMDA. Within 4 h, this agent caused a prolonged decrease in the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system as shown by disassembly of 26S proteasomes, decrease in ubiquitin-protein conjugates, and dissociation of the ubiquitin ligases UBE3A (E6-AP) and HUWE1 from the proteasome. Surprisingly, the regulatory 19S particles were rapidly degraded by proteasomal, not lysosomal degradation, and the dissociated E3 enzymes also degraded. Thus the content of proteasomes and their set of associated proteins can be altered by neuronal activity, in a manner likely to influence synaptic plasticity and learning.},

Loss of MT-stabilizing tau function, caused by misfolding, hyperphosphorylation, and sequestration of tau into insoluble aggregates, leads to axonal transport deficits with neuropathological consequences. Several in vitro and preclinical in vivo studies have shown that MT-stabilizing drugs can be utilized to compensate for the loss of tau function and to maintain/restore effective axonal transport. These findings indicate that MT-stabilizing compounds hold considerable promise for the treatment of Alzheimer disease and related tauopathies.

The MEC and LEC projections in the temporoammonic pathway are topographically organized along the transverse-axis of area CA1. The potential for functional segregation of area CA1, however, remains relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrated differential novelty-induced c-Fos expression along the transverse-axis of area CA1 corresponding to topographic projections of MEC and LEC inputs. We found that, while novel place exposure induced a uniform c-Fos expression along the transverse-axis of area CA1, novel object exposure primarily activated the distal half of CA1 neurons. In hippocampal slices, we observed distinct presynaptic properties between LEC and MEC terminals, and application of either DA or NE produced a largely selective influence on one set of inputs (LEC). Finally, we demonstrated that differential c-Fos expression along the transverse axis of area CA1 was largely abolished by an antagonist of neuromodulatory receptors, clozapine. Our results suggest that neuromodulators can control topographic TA projections allowing the hippocampus to differentially encode new information along the transverse axis of area CA1. 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Src PTKs also play a critical role in the regulation of vascular permeability and inflammatory responses in tissue cells. Importantly, animal studies have demonstrated that small chemical inhibitors for Src PTKs attenuate tissue injury and improve survival from a variety of pathological conditions related to acute inflammatory responses.

abstract = {Mammalian stress responses present a case study for investigating alternative splicing reactions in general, and changes in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene expression in particular, under endangered homeostasis. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a major regulator of stress responses, which was recently found to function as an essential route by which neurons can "talk" to immune cells. Therefore, chemical, physical, or psychological insults to the brain might all be traced in peripheral immune cells, which serve as key determinants in the physiological reactions to stress. Stress-induced changes in the alternative splicing patterns of AChE pre-mRNA give this gene and its different protein products diverse stress responsive functions that are associated with both the enzymatic and noncatalytic properties of AChE variants. Transgenic manipulations of AChE gene expression uncovered previously nonperceived aspects of stress responses, including brain-to-blood as well as immune-to-neuronal communication. Herein we discuss the newly gained understanding achieved by using genomic manipulations of AChE gene expression as tools for approaching the alternative splicing features of mammalian stress responses.},

Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome.

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 19 to 25 nucleotides non-coding RNAs known to possess important post-transcriptional regulatory functions. Identifying targeting genes that miRNAs regulate are important for understanding their specific biological functions. Usually, miRNAs down-regulate target genes through binding to the complementary sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the targets. In part, due to the large number of miRNAs and potential targets, an experimental based prediction design would be extremely laborious and economically unfavorable. However, since the bindings of the animal miRNAs are not a perfect one-to-one match with the complementary sites of their targets, it is difficult to predict targets of animal miRNAs by accessing their alignment to the 3' UTRs of potential targets. Consequently, sophisticated computational approaches for miRNA target prediction are being considered as essential methods in miRNA research.We surveyed most of the current computational miRNA target prediction algorithms in this paper. Particularly, we provided a mathematical definition and formulated the problem of target prediction under the framework of statistical classification. Moreover, we summarized the features of miRNA-target pairs in target prediction approaches and discussed these approaches according to two categories, which are the rule-based and the data-driven approaches. The rule-based approach derives the classifier mainly on biological prior knowledge and important observations from biological experiments, whereas the data driven approach builds statistic models using the training data and makes predictions based on the models. Finally, we tested a few different algorithms on a set of experimentally validated true miRNA-target pairs [1] and a set of false miRNA-target pairs, derived from miRNA overexpression experiment [2]. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to show the performances of these algorithms.},

To systematically chart its regulatory functions, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to disrupt all six miR-124 alleles in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Upon neuronal induction, miR-124-deleted cells underwent neurogenesis and became functional neurons, albeit with altered morphology and neurotransmitter specification. Using RNA-induced-silencing-complex precipitation, we identified 98 high-confidence miR-124 targets, of which some directly led to decreased viability. By performing advanced transcription-factor-network analysis, we identified indirect miR-124 effects on apoptosis, neuronal subtype differentiation, and the regulation of previously uncharacterized zinc finger transcription factors. Our data emphasize the need for combined experimental- and system-level analyses to comprehensively disentangle and reveal miRNA functions, including their involvement in the neurogenesis of diverse neuronal cell types found in the human brain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to test whether silencing of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) in cardiac macrophages improves infarct healing and attenuates post-myocardial infarction (MI) remodeling. BACKGROUND In healing wounds, the M1 toward M2 macrophage phenotype transition supports resolution of inflammation and tissue repair. Persistence of inflammatory M1 macrophages may derail healing and compromise organ functions. The transcription factor IRF5 up-regulates genes associated with M1 macrophages. METHODS Here we used nanoparticle-delivered small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) to silence IRF5 in macrophages residing in MIs and in surgically-induced skin wounds in mice. RESULTS Infarct macrophages expressed high levels of IRF5 during the early inflammatory wound-healing stages (day 4 after coronary ligation), whereas expression of the transcription factor decreased during the resolution of inflammation (day 8). Following in vitro screening, we identified an siRNA sequence that, when delivered by nanoparticles to wound macrophages, efficiently suppressed expression of IRF5 in vivo. Reduction of IRF5 expression, a factor that regulates macrophage polarization, reduced expression of inflammatory M1 macrophage markers, supported resolution of inflammation, accelerated cutaneous and infarct healing, and attenuated development of post-MI heart failure after coronary ligation as measured by protease targeted fluorescence molecular tomography-computed tomography imaging and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This work identified a new therapeutic avenue to augment resolution of inflammation in healing infarcts by macrophage phenotype manipulation. This therapeutic concept may be used to attenuate post-MI remodeling and heart failure.},

abstract = {Although the last years have seen an increasing interest in schizotypy and its pathogenesis, there exist only a handful of studies examining the possible interaction between season of birth (SOB) and schizotypic personality structure. Available research used differing screening instruments, rendering comparisons between studies difficult, and sample sizes in adult populations may have been too small to detect a mild effect. The current study examined the association between SOB and psychometric schizotypy in the so far single-largest sample from the adult general population (N=8114), balanced for men and women, and utilizing a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of schizotypy. Using the 12 most informative items of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire Brief, we obtained evidence of a small, but significant, effect of late winter and early spring births (February/March) on psychometric schizotypy. The effect was not constrained to women, but affected men and women alike. The observed association between SOB and schizotypy appears compatible with seasonal variations of temperature and influenza prevalence, and with recent evidence on seasonal variability in the activity of the human immune system. Our findings lend support to the continuum hypothesis of schizotypy and schizophrenia, for which SOB effects have been previously established.},

abstract = {MicroRNA (miRNA) functions in the pathogenesis of major neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are only beginning to emerge. We have observed significantly elevated levels of a specific miRNA, miR-26b, in the defined pathological areas of human postmortem brains, starting from early stages of AD (Braak III). Ectopic overexpression of miR-26b in rat primary postmitotic neurons led to the DNA replication and aberrant cell cycle entry (CCE) and, in parallel, increased tau-phosphorylation, which culminated in the apoptotic cell death of neurons. Similar tau hyperphosphorylation and CCE are typical features of neurons in pre-AD brains. Sequence-specific inhibition of miR-26b in culture is neuroprotective against oxidative stress. Retinoblastoma protein (Rb1), a major tumor suppressor, appears as the key direct miR-26b target, which mediates the observed neuronal phenotypes. The downstream signaling involves upregulation of Rb1/E2F cell cycle and pro-apoptotic transcriptional targets, including cyclin E1, and corresponding downregulation of cell cycle inhibitor p27/Kip1. It further leads to nuclear export and activation of Cdk5, a major kinase implicated in tau phosphorylation, regulation of cell cycle, and death in postmitotic neurons. Therefore, upregulation of miR-26b in neurons causes pleiotropic phenotypes that are also observed in AD. Elevated levels of miR-26b may thus contribute to the AD neuronal pathology.},

abstract = {Cognitive flexibility, the ability to adjust behavior in response to new and unexpected conditions in the environment, is essential for adaptation to new challenges and survival. The cholinergic system is an important modulator of this complex behavior however, the exact cholinergic circuits involved in this modulation and the precise influence of acetylcholine (ACh) in the process is still not fully understood. Here we review the role of different cholinergic circuits in cognitive flexibility. Strong evidence indicates that cholinergic interneurons (CINs) from the dorsomedial striatum are essential for facilitating the establishment of a new selected strategy; an effect that seems to depend mainly on activation of muscarinic receptors. Cholinergic neurons from the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nBM), which project to the prefrontal cortex, seem to modulate the initial inhibition of a previously learned strategy, however, this concept is still controversial. Additionally, some studies suggest that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons projecting to the hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, and posterior parietal cortex may also participate on the modulation of cognitive flexibility. We highlight the fact that when investigating effects of ACh on behavioral flexibility, or any other behavior, one has to keep in mind two important particularities of the cholinergic system: (1) Many cholinergic neurons in the brain co-release glutamate or GABA with ACh. Methodologies that rely on neuronal silencing or ablation lead to simultaneous elimination of both neurotransmitters, making interpretation of results complex. (2) The cholinergic gene locus has a unique organization, with the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) gene present within the intron between the first and second exons of the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) gene. Thus, behavioral studies using transgenic animals generated with ChAT bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones should be considered carefully, taking into consideration that these mice may overexpress VAChT and therefore, present a hypercholinergic tone that can be a confounder in behavioral studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators that have been demonstrated to play an important role in human diseases. Elucidating the associations between miRNAs and diseases at the systematic level will deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of diseases. However, miRNA-disease associations identified by previous computational methods are far from completeness and more effort is needed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We developed a computational framework to identify miRNA-disease associations by performing random walk analysis, and focused on the functional link between miRNA targets and disease genes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Furthermore, a bipartite miRNA-disease network was constructed, from which several miRNA-disease co-regulated modules were identified by hierarchical clustering analysis. Our approach achieved satisfactory performance in identifying known cancer-related miRNAs for nine human cancers with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) ranging from 71.3{\%} to 91.3{\%}. By systematically analyzing the global properties of the miRNA-disease network, we found that only a small number of miRNAs regulated genes involved in various diseases, genes associated with neurological diseases were preferentially regulated by miRNAs and some immunological diseases were associated with several specific miRNAs. We also observed that most diseases in the same co-regulated module tended to belong to the same disease category, indicating that these diseases might share similar miRNA regulatory mechanisms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, we present a computational framework to identify miRNA-disease associations, and further construct a bipartite miRNA-disease network for systematically analyzing the global properties of miRNA regulation of disease genes. Our findings provide a broad perspective on the relationships between miRNAs and diseases and could potentially aid future research efforts concerning miRNA involvement in disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Bipolar disorder is a unique illness characterized by fluctuations between mood states of depression and mania. Originally, an adrenergic-cholinergic balance hypothesis was postulated to underlie these different affective states. In this review, we update this hypothesis with recent findings from human and animal studies, suggesting that a catecholaminergic-cholinergic hypothesis may be more relevant. Evidence from neuroimaging studies, neuropharmacological interventions, and genetic associations support the notion that increased cholinergic functioning underlies depression, whereas increased activations of the catecholamines (dopamine and norepinephrine) underlie mania. Elevated functional acetylcholine during depression may affect both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in a compensatory fashion. Increased functional dopamine and norepinephrine during mania on the other hand may affect receptor expression and functioning of dopamine reuptake transporters. Despite increasing evidence supporting this hypothesis, a relationship between these two neurotransmitter systems that could explain cycling between states of depression and mania is missing. Future studies should focus on the influence of environmental stimuli and genetic susceptibilities that may affect the catecholaminergic-cholinergic balance underlying cycling between the affective states. Overall, observations from recent studies add important data to this revised balance theory of bipolar disorder, renewing interest in this field of research.},

The consequences of tau pathology were investigated here by proteomics followed by functional analysis. Mainly metabolism-related proteins including mitochondrial respiratory chain complex components, antioxidant enzymes, and synaptic proteins were identified as modified in the proteome pattern of P301L tau mice. Significantly, the reduction in mitochondrial complex V levels in the P301L tau mice revealed using proteomics was also confirmed as decreased in human P301L FTDP-17 (frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17) brains. Functional analysis demonstrated a mitochondrial dysfunction in P301L tau mice together with reduced NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity and, with age, impaired mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Mitochondrial dys-function was associated with higher levels of reactive oxygen species in aged transgenic mice. Increased tau pathology as in aged homozygous P301L tau mice revealed modified lipid peroxidation levels and the up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes in response to oxidative stress. Furthermore, P301L tau mitochondria displayed increased vulnerability toward beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide insult, suggesting a synergistic action of tau and Abeta pathology on the mitochondria. Taken together, we conclude that tau pathology involves a mitochondrial and oxidative stress disorder possibly distinct from that caused by Abeta.},

abstract = {The altered expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised much interest of late. Despite an overall decrease in the AD brain, the activity of AChE increases around beta-amyloid plaques and indeed, the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) can influence AChE levels. Such evidence stimulated our interest in the possibility that the levels of AChE and amyloid might vary together in AD. We previously found that the different AChE forms present in both the brain and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients varied in conjunction with abnormal glycosylation. Thus, the alterations in glycosylation are correlated with the accumulation of a minor subspecies of AChE monomers. We also recently analysed whether long-term exposure to the cholinesterase inhibitor (ChE-I) donepezil influences the AChE species found in AD CSF. The marked increase in CSF-AChE activity in AD patients following long-term treatment with donepezil was not paralleled by a rise in this subset of light variants. Hence, the correlation with the levels of CSF-Abeta is unique to these AChE species in patients receiving such treatment. The aim of this report is to review the links between AChE and beta-amyloid, and to discuss the significance of the responses of the distinct AChE species to ChE-I during the treatment of AD.},

We show that astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-specific genes, but not neuron-specific genes, shift their regional expression patterns upon aging, particularly in the hippocampus and substantia nigra, while the expression of microglia- and endothelial-specific genes increase in all brain regions. In line with these changes, high-resolution immunohistochemistry demonstrated decreased numbers of oligodendrocytes and of neuronal subpopulations in the aging brain cortex. Finally, glial-specific genes predict age with greater precision than neuron-specific genes, thus highlighting the need for greater mechanistic understanding of neuron-glia interactions in aging and late-life diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Measurement of vascular density has significant value in characterizing healthy and diseased tissue, particularly in brain where vascular density varies among regions. Further, an understanding of brain vessel size helps distinguish between capillaries and larger vessels like arterioles and venules. Unfortunately, few cutting edge methodologies are available to laboratories to rapidly quantify vessel density. NEW METHOD We developed a rapid microscopic method, which quantifies the numbers and diameters of blood vessels in brain. Utilizing this method we characterized vascular density of five brain regions in both mice and rats, in two tumor models, using three tracers. RESULTS We observed the number of sections/mm(2) in various brain regions: genu of corpus callosum 161±7, hippocampus 266±18, superior colliculus 300±24, frontal cortex 391±55, and inferior colliculus 692±18 (n=5 animals). Regional brain data were not significantly different between species (p{\textgreater}0.05) or when using different tracers (70kDa and 2000kDa Texas Red; p{\textgreater}0.05). Vascular density decreased (62-79{\%}) in preclinical brain metastases but increased (62{\%}) a rat glioma model. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS Our values were similar (p{\textgreater}0.05) to published literature. We applied this method to brain-tumors and observed brain metastases of breast cancer to have a ∼2.5-fold reduction (p{\textgreater}0.05) in vessels/mm(2) compared to normal cortical regions. In contrast, vascular density in a glioma model was significantly higher (sections/mm(2) 736±84; p{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSIONS In summary, we present a vascular density counting method that is rapid, sensitive, and uses fluorescence microscopy without antibodies.},

Cohen that a rabbit antiserum against a protein fraction of the salivary gland inactivates the in vitro nerve-growth effects of this protein (pp. 302–311, these Proceedings) suggested to him to test the effects of the anti-serum on newborn mice. The finding of a remarkable decrease in size of the sympathetic ganglia of the injected mice prompted an extensive investigation of the effects of the antiserum on the sympathetic ganglia of mice and other mammals. The results of this study are reported in the following pages. Materials and Methods. —Newborn mice were injected daily with 0.05 ml of the rabbit antiserum per 1.5 gm of body weight.† Controls of the same litters were either injected with serum of a normal rabbit, or they were not treated at all. Twenty experimental and twenty control mice were sacrificed between the 12th hour after the first injection and the 25th day. Two groups of newborn mice, injected for 8 and 20 days respectively after birth, were sacrificed three and four months after the termination of the treatment. An equal number of untreated mice of the same litters were available for control. The same techniques as used in the previous experiments (pages 373–384) were used for area measurements, cell and mitotic counts, and for histological examination. The effect of the rabbit antiserum was then tested on newborn rats, rabbits, and one pair of kittens.

abstract = {Background and Purpose - Monocytes participate in adaptive and innate immune responses. Monocyte numbers increase in patients with stroke associated infection (S AI) or severe stroke. Whether changes in monocytes are related to specific effects, or simply mark brain damage, remains unsettled. Methods - We used flow cytometry in 45 consecutive strokes and 12 healthy controls to assess the time course of monocytes, their phenotype, and the production of cytokines after stimulation. Cortisol, TNF-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$, and IL-10 were measured in serum and metanephrine in plasma. The effects of humoral and cellular parameters on the risk of SAI and poor outcome were tested in multivariate analyses adjusted for confounders (NIHSS score, age, and tube feeding). Results - Surface expression of human leukocyte antigen-DR, Toll-like receptor-2, and production of TNF-a in monocytes were independently associated with stroke. Distinct immune mechanisms were related with functional outcome and the risk of SAI; the signature of SAI included an increase of cortisol, metanephrine, and IL-10 in serum, and reduced production of TNF-$\alpha$ in monocytes; poor outcome was associated with increased expression of Toll-like receptor-4 in monocytes (OR, 9.61; 95{\%} CI, 1.27-72.47). SAI did not predict poor outcome (OR, 5.63; 95{\%} CI, 0.45-70.42; P=0.18). Conclusions - In human stroke, poor outcome is associated to innate responses mediated by Toll-like receptor-4 in monocytes. SAI may result from the immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory effects of corticoids, catecholamines, IL-10, and deactivated monocytes. Early treated SAI does not contribute significantly to additional brain damage. These findings encourage the exploration of strategies aimed to inhibit Toll-like receptor-4 signaling in acute stroke. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Cholinergic neurons in PNS and CNS are identified by the presence of choline acetyltransferase and the accumulation of choline by a high-affinity, sodium-coupled choline transporter to be used for acetylcholine synthesis. It appears that expression of choline acetyltransferase can be altered by several physiological conditions, including hormones and trophic factors, but little is known about control of expression of the sodium-coupled choline carrier or whether these two phenotypic markers are regulated similarly. In the present study, the cholinergic human neuroblastoma LA-N-2 was used to investigate regulation of expression of choline acetyltransferase and choline uptake activity associated with differentiation and neurite extension. Cells grown in serum-containing basal medium maintained a relatively undifferentiated morphology, expressed low levels of choline acetyltransferase activity, and accumulated choline by a sodium-dependent process followed by conversion to acetylcholine. Transfer of cells to an enriched, serum-free defined medium resulted in morphological and neurochemical differentiation, with an enhancement of cholinergic phenotype. Hemicholinium-sensitive choline uptake activity was increased about sixfold over a 4-day period, with no change in choline acetyltransferase or acetylcholinesterase specific activity. Acetylcholine synthesis was increased in parallel with the changes in choline accumulation; choline metabolism in the differentiated cells differed significantly from that observed in the undifferentiated cells, with proportionally less converted to phosphorylcholine and proportionally more remaining as unmetabolized choline and converted to acetylcholine. The enhanced choline accumulation appeared to be mediated by an increased number of choline carriers, demonstrated by increased binding of the affinity ligand [3H]-choline mustard to the transporter and by an increased Vmax for the uptake process. The increased expression of the transport function appeared to be under transcriptional control, as the enhancement of uptake was blocked by the RNA polymerase II inhibitor alpha-amanitin as well as by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. These results show that expression of sodium-coupled choline carriers and choline acetyltransferase may be regulated separately in the differentiating neuroblastoma LA-N-2 and that neurotransmitter synthesis is controlled by provision of precursor rather than at the level of the biosynthetic enzyme.},

abstract = {The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) plays an important role in learning by enhancing the saliency of behaviorally relevant stimuli. How this stimulus selection is achieved on the cellular level, however, is not known. Here, in recordings from hippocampal slices, we show that DA acts specifically at the direct cortical input to hippocampal area CA1 (the temporoammonic (TA) pathway) to filter the excitatory drive onto pyramidal neurons based on the input frequency. During low-frequency patterns of stimulation, DA depressed excitatory TA inputs to both CA1 pyramidal neurons and local inhibitory GABAergic interneurons via presynaptic inhibition. In contrast, during high-frequency patterns of stimulation, DA potently facilitated the TA excitatory drive onto CA1 pyramidal neurons, owing to diminished feedforward inhibition. Analysis of DA's effects over a broad range of stimulus frequencies indicates that it acts as a high-pass filter, augmenting the response to high-frequency inputs while diminishing the impact of low-frequency inputs. These modulatory effects of DA exert a profound influence on activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity at both TA-CA1 and Schaffer-collateral (SC)-CA1 synapses. Taken together, our data demonstrate that DA acts as a gate on the direct cortical input to the hippocampus, modulating information flow and synaptic plasticity in a frequency-dependent manner.},

abstract = {In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus is responsible for the generation of most circadian rhythms and their entrainment to environmental cues. Cholinergic agents can alter circadian rhythm phase, and fibres immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase, the biosynthetic enzyme for acetylcholine, are present in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Since there are no cholinergic somata in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, these fibres must represent the terminals of cholinergic neurons whose cell bodies are located elsewhere in the brain. This study was aimed at locating the cholinergic neurons that project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus by retrograde and anterograde tract-tracing and immunohistochemistry for choline acetyltransferase in the rat. After injection of fluorogold, a retrograde tracer, into the suprachiasmatic nucleus, retrogradely labelled neurons that were immunopositive for choline acetyltransferase were located throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the cholinergic basal nuclear complex, with highest densities in the substantia innominata and the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. A few cells were also located in the medial septum and in the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band of Broca. In the brainstem, double-labelled neurons were located in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and the parabigeminal nucleus. Injections of the anterograde tracer biocytin in these three brainstem nuclei resulted in fibre labelling in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, consistent with the retrograde findings. No clearly double-labelled cells were located in the retina. These results suggest that the suprachiasmatic nucleus receives cholinergic afferents from both the basal forebrain and mesopontine tegmentum which may mediate cholinergic effects on circadian rhythms.},

The responses varied greatly across PNs and across odors for the same PN. Surprisingly, this diversity across the population was highly constrained, and most responses were captured by a quantitative model with just 3 parameters. Individual PNs were found to communicate odor information at rates up to approximately 4 bits/s. A small group of PNs was sufficient to provide an accurate representation of the dynamic odor time course, whose quality was maximal for fluctuations of frequency approximately 0.8 Hz. We develop a simple model for the encoding of dynamic odor stimuli that accounts for many prior observations on the population response.},

abstract = {Depression is a highly heterogeneous disorder presumably caused by a combination of several factors ultimately causing the pathological condition. The genetic liability model of depression is likely to be of polygenic heterogeneity. miRNAs can regulate multiple genes simultaneously and therefore are candidates that align with this model. The habenula has been linked to depression in both clinical and animal studies, shifting interest towards this region as a neural substrate in depression. The goal of the present study was to search for alterations in miRNA expression levels in the medial and lateral habenula of rats exposed to the learned helplessness (LH) rat model of depression. Ten miRNAs showed significant alterations associating with their response to the LH paradigm. Of these, six and four miRNAs were significantly regulated in the MHb and LHb, respectively. In the MHb we identified miR-490, miR-291a-3p, MiR-467a, miR-216a, miR-18b, and miR-302a. In the LHb miR-543, miR-367, miR-467c, and miR-760-5p were significantly regulated. A target gene analysis showed that several of the target genes are involved in MAPK signaling, neutrophin signaling, and ErbB signaling, indicating that neurotransmission is affected in the habenula as a consequence of exposure to the LH paradigm.

This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology (GO). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the GO terms into the calculation of the statistical significance. RESULTS We present two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using the underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point to relevant areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.},

abstract = {A novel microRNA (miRNA) quantification method has been developed using stem-loop RT followed by TaqMan PCR analysis. Stem-loop RT primers are better than conventional ones in terms of RT efficiency and specificity. TaqMan miRNA assays are specific for mature miRNAs and discriminate among related miRNAs that differ by as little as one nucleotide. Furthermore, they are not affected by genomic DNA contamination. Precise quantification is achieved routinely with as little as 25 pg of total RNA for most miRNAs. In fact, the high sensitivity, specificity and precision of this method allows for direct analysis of a single cell without nucleic acid purification. Like standard TaqMan gene expression assays, TaqMan miRNA assays exhibit a dynamic range of seven orders of magnitude. Quantification of five miRNAs in seven mouse tissues showed variation from less than 10 to more than 30,000 copies per cell. This method enables fast, accurate and sensitive miRNA expression profiling and can identify and monitor potential biomarkers specific to tissues or diseases. Stem-loop RT-PCR can be used for the quantification of other small RNA molecules such as short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Furthermore, the concept of stem-loop RT primer design could be applied in small RNA cloning and multiplex assays for better specificity and efficiency.},

abstract = {1. We studied the theoretical prediction that a loss of plant species richness has a strong impact on community interactions among all trophic levels and tested whether decreased plant species diversity results in a less complex structure and reduced interactions in ecological networks. 2. Using plant species-specific biomass and arthropod abundance data from experimental grassland plots (Jena Experiment), we constructed multitrophic functional group interaction webs to compare communities based on 4 and 16 plant species. 427 insect and spider species were classified into 13 functional groups. These functional groups represent the nodes of ecological networks. Direct and indirect interactions among them were assessed using partial Mantel tests. Interaction web complexity was quantified using three measures of network structure: connectance, interaction diversity and interaction strength. 3. Compared with high plant diversity plots, interaction webs based on low plant diversity plots showed reduced complexity in terms of total connectance, interaction diversity and mean interaction strength. Plant diversity effects obviously cascade up the food web and modify interactions across all trophic levels. The strongest effects occurred in interactions between adjacent trophic levels (i.e. predominantly trophic interactions), while significant interactions among plant and carnivore functional groups, as well as horizontal interactions (i.e. interactions between functional groups of the same trophic level), showed rather inconsistent responses and were generally rarer. 4. Reduced interaction diversity has the potential to decrease and destabilize ecosystem processes. Therefore, we conclude that the loss of basal producer species leads to more simple structured, less and more loosely connected species assemblages, which in turn are very likely to decrease ecosystem functioning, community robustness and tolerance to disturbance. Our results suggest that the functioning of the entire ecological community is critically linked to the diversity of its component plants species.},

abstract = {Forebrain cholinergic neurons play important roles as striatal local circuit neurons and basal telencephalic projection neurons. The genetic mechanisms that control development of these neurons suggest that most of them are derived from the basal telencephalon where Lhx8, a LIM-homeobox gene, is expressed. Here we report that mice with a null mutation of Lhx8 are deficient in the development of forebrain cholinergic neurons. Lhx8 mutants lack the nucleus basalis, a major source of the cholinergic input to the cerebral cortex. In addition, the number of cholinergic neurons is reduced in several other areas of the subcortical forebrain in Lhx8 mutants, including the caudate-putamen, medial septal nucleus, nucleus of the diagonal band, and magnocellular preoptic nucleus. Although cholinergic neurons are not formed, initial steps in their specification appear to be preserved, as indicated by a presence of cells expressing a truncated Lhx8 mRNA and mRNA of the homeobox gene Gbx1. These results provide genetic evidence supporting an important role for Lhx8 in development of cholinergic neurons in the forebrain.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial and fatal neurodegenerative disorder for which the mechanisms leading to profound neuronal loss are incompletely recognized. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recently discovered small regulatory RNA molecules that repress gene expression and are increasingly acknowledged as prime regulators involved in human brain pathologies. Here we identified two homologous miRNAs, miR-132 and miR-212, downregulated in temporal cortical areas and CA1 hippocampal neurons of human AD brains. Sequence-specific inhibition of miR-132 and miR-212 induces apoptosis in cultured primary neurons, whereas their overexpression is neuroprotective against oxidative stress. Using primary neurons and PC12 cells, we demonstrate that miR-132/212 controls cell survival by direct regulation of PTEN, FOXO3a and P300, which are all key elements of AKT signaling pathway. Silencing of these three target genes by RNAi abrogates apoptosis caused by the miR-132/212 inhibition. We further demonstrate that mRNA and protein levels of PTEN, FOXO3a, P300 and most of the direct pro-apoptotic transcriptional targets of FOXO3a are significantly elevated in human AD brains. These results indicate that the miR-132/miR-212/PTEN/FOXO3a signaling pathway contributes to AD neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), cholinergic neurons are particularly vulnerable for as yet unclear reasons. Here, we report that modified composition, localization and properties of alternative splice variants encoding the acetylcholine-hydrolyzing enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) may be variably involved in disease progression or in systemic efforts to attenuate its progression. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the implications for AD of the cellular and biochemical properties of the various AChE proteins, differing in their N and C termini. Methods: We have used cell transfection with genetically engineered vectors as well as microinjection to overexpress specific AChE variants and explore the consequences to cellular well-being and survival. Additionally, we employed highly purified recombinant AChE-R and AChE-S to explore putative interactions with the AD beta-amyloid peptide. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate distinct, and in certain cases inverse cell fate outcome under enforced expression of the human N- and C-terminally modified AChE variants, all of which have similar enzymatic activities. CONCLUSION: The N-terminal extension in conjunction with the primary helical C-terminal peptide of 'tailed' AChE-S facilitates, whereas the shorter, naturally unfolded C-terminus of the stress-induced AChE-R variant attenuates Alzheimer's pathology.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a recently discovered class of small, non-coding RNA molecules of 21-25 nucleotides in length that regulate the gene expression by base-pairing with the transcripts of their targets i.e. protein-coding genes, leading to down-regulation or repression of the target genes. However, target gene activation has also been described. miRNAs are involved in diverse regulatory pathways, including control of developmental timing, apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, modulation of immune response to macrophages, and organ development and are associated with many diseases, such as cancer. Computational prediction of miRNA targets is much more challenging in animals than in plants, because animal miRNAs often perform imperfect base-pairing with their target sites, unlike plant miRNAs which almost always bind their targets with near perfect complementarity. In the past years, a large number of target prediction programs and databases on experimentally validated information have been developed for animal miRNAs to fulfil the need of experimental scientists conducting miRNA research. In this review we first succinctly describe the prediction criteria (rules or principles) adapted by prediction algorithms to generate possible miRNA binding site interactions and introduce most relevant algorithms, and databases. We then summarize their applications with the help of some previously published studies. We further provide experimentally validated functional binding sites outside 3'-UTR region of target mRNAs and the resources which offer such predictions. Finally, the issue of experimental validation of miRNA binding sites will be briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Human neurons are functional over an entire lifetime, yet the mechanisms that preserve function and protect against neurodegeneration during ageing are unknown. Here we show that induction of the repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST; also known as neuron-restrictive silencer factor, NRSF) is a universal feature of normal ageing in human cortical and hippocampal neurons. REST is lost, however, in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing and expression analysis show that REST represses genes that promote cell death and Alzheimer's disease pathology, and induces the expression of stress response genes. Moreover, REST potently protects neurons from oxidative stress and amyloid $\beta$-protein toxicity, and conditional deletion of REST in the mouse brain leads to age-related neurodegeneration. A functional orthologue of REST, Caenorhabditis elegans SPR-4, also protects against oxidative stress and amyloid $\beta$-protein toxicity. During normal ageing, REST is induced in part by cell non-autonomous Wnt signalling. However, in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, REST is lost from the nucleus and appears in autophagosomes together with pathological misfolded proteins. Finally, REST levels during ageing are closely correlated with cognitive preservation and longevity. Thus, the activation state of REST may distinguish neuroprotection from neurodegeneration in the ageing brain.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem neurodegenerative disorder affecting, besides the dopaminergic function, multiple neurotransmission systems, including the cholinergic system. Central cholinergic circuits of human brain can be tested non-invasively by coupling peripheral nerve stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex; this test is named short latency afferent inhibition (SAI). SAI abnormalities have been reported in PD patients with gait disturbances and many non-motor symptoms, such as visual hallucinations (VHs), REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), dysphagia, and olfactory impairment. The findings of these TMS studies strongly suggest that cholinergic degeneration is an important contributor to a number of clinical features of PD. TMS and neuropsychological raise the possibility that the presence of RBD, VHs and olfactory dysfunction indicate increased risk of cognitive impairment in patients with PD. Longitudinal studies of the patients are required to verify whether SAI abnormalities can predict a future severe cognitive decline. TMS can provide simple measures that may represent suitable biomarkers of cholinergic neurotransmission in PD. SAI studies enable an early recognition of PD patients with cholinergic system degeneration, and this might allow future targeted cholinergic treatment approaches, in addition to dopaminergic therapy, to ameliorate non-motor and motor clinical symptoms in PD patients.},

abstract = {A cardinal symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) is the disruption of circadian patterns. However, to date, there is no direct evidence of circadian clock dysregulation in the brains of patients who have MDD. Circadian rhythmicity of gene expression has been observed in animals and peripheral human tissues, but its presence and variability in the human brain were difficult to characterize. Here, we applied time-of-death analysis to gene expression data from high-quality postmortem brains, examining 24-h cyclic patterns in six cortical and limbic regions of 55 subjects with no history of psychiatric or neurological illnesses ("controls") and 34 patients with MDD. Our dataset covered {\~{}}12,000 transcripts in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and cerebellum. Several hundred transcripts in each region showed 24-h cyclic patterns in controls, and {\textgreater}100 transcripts exhibited consistent rhythmicity and phase synchrony across regions. Among the top-ranked rhythmic genes were the canonical clock genes BMAL1(ARNTL), PER1-2-3, NR1D1(REV-ERBa), DBP, BHLHE40 (DEC1), and BHLHE41(DEC2). The phasing of known circadian genes was consistent with data derived from other diurnal mammals. Cyclic patterns were much weaker in the brains of patients with MDD due to shifted peak timing and potentially disrupted phase relationships between individual circadian genes. This transcriptome-wide analysis of the human brain demonstrates a rhythmic rise and fall of gene expression in regions outside of the suprachiasmatic nucleus in control subjects. The description of its breakdown in MDD suggests potentially important molecular targets for treatment of mood disorders.},

abstract = {Diverse stress stimuli induce long-lasting cognitive deficits, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. Here, we report three different stress models demonstrating that stress-inducible increases in microRNA-132 (miR-132) and consequent decreases in its acetylcholinesterase (AChE) target are causally involved. In a mild model of predator scent-induced anxiety, we demonstrate long-lasting hippocampal elevation of miR-132, accompanied by and associated with reduced AChE activity. Using lentiviral-mediated suppression of "synaptic" AChE-S mRNA, we quantified footshock stress-inducible changes in miR-132 and AChE and its corresponding cognitive damages. Stressed mice showed long-lasting impairments in the Morris water maze. In contrast, pre-stress injected AChE-suppressing lentivirus, but not a control virus, reduced hippocampal levels of both miR-132 and AChE and maintained similar cognitive performance to that of na{\"{i}}ve, non-stressed mice. To dissociate between miR-132 and synaptic AChE-S as potential causes for stress-inducible cognitive deficits, we further used engineered TgR mice with enforced over-expression of the soluble "readthrough" AChE-R variant without the 3'-untranslated region binding site for miR-132. TgR mice displayed excess AChE-R in hippocampal neurons, enhanced c-fos labeling and correspondingly intensified reaction to the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine. They further showed excessive hippocampal expression of miR-132, accompanied by reduced host AChE-S mRNA and the GTPase activator p250GAP target of miR-132. At the behavioral level, TgR mice showed abnormal nocturnal locomotion patterns and serial maze mal-performance in spite of their reduced AChE-S levels. Our findings attribute stress-inducible cognitive impairments to cholinergic-mediated induction of miR-132 and consequently suppressed ACHE-S, opening venues for intercepting these miR-132-mediated damages.},

From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

We differentiated SH-SY5Y human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells to a neuronal-like state in a perfusion culture system using a combination of retinoic acid and mitotic inhibitors.

We show, by various means, that the differentiated cells exhibit, at the molecular level, many neuronal properties not characteristic to the starting line.

During the last decade, substantial knowledge has accumulated regarding the biogenesis of miRNAs, their molecular mechanisms and functional roles in a variety of cellular contexts. Altered expression of certain miRNA molecules in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson suggests that miRNAs could have a crucial regulatory role in these disorders. Polymorphisms in miRNA target sites may also constitute an important determinant of disease risk. Additionally, emerging evidence points to specific miRNAs targeting and regulating the expression of particular proteins that are key to disease pathogenesis. Considering that the amount of these proteins in susceptible neuronal populations appears to be critical to neurodegeneration, miRNA-mediated regulation represents a new target of significant therapeutic prospects. In this review, the implications of miRNAs in several neurodegenerative disorders and their potential as therapeutic interventions are discussed.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are versatile regulators of gene expression with profound implications for human disease including atherosclerosis, but whether they can exert posttranslational functions to control cell adaptation and whether such noncanonical features harbor pathophysiological relevance is unknown. Here, we show that miR-126-5p sustains endothelial integrity in the context of high shear stress and autophagy. Bound to argonaute-2 (Ago2), miR-126-5p forms a complex with Mex3a, which occurs on the surface of autophagic vesicles and guides its transport into the nucleus. Mutational studies and biophysical measurements demonstrate that Mex3a binds to the central U- and G-rich regions of miR-126-5p with nanomolar affinity via its two K homology domains. In the nucleus, miR-126-5p dissociates from Ago2 and binds to caspase-3 in an aptamer-like fashion with its seed sequence, preventing dimerization of the caspase and inhibiting its activity to limit apoptosis. The antiapoptotic effect of miR-126-5p outside of the RNA-induced silencing complex is important for endothelial integrity under conditions of high shear stress promoting autophagy: ablation of Mex3a or ATG5 in vivo attenuates nuclear import of miR-126-5p, aggravates endothelial apoptosis, and exacerbates atherosclerosis. In human plaques, we found reduced nuclear miR-126-5p and active caspase-3 in areas of disturbed flow. The direct inhibition of caspase-3 by nuclear miR-126-5p reveals a noncanonical mechanism by which miRNAs can modulate protein function.},

Strikingly, a large fraction (41{\%}) of these genes showed a strong cis-association with genotype only in a single cell type.

abstract = {Cholinergic transmission in the striatal complex is critical for the modulation of the activity of local microcircuits and dopamine release. Release of acetylcholine has been considered to originate exclusively from a subtype of striatal interneuron that provides widespread innervation of the striatum. Cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine (PPN) and laterodorsal tegmental (LDT) nuclei indirectly influence the activity of the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens through their innervation of dopamine and thalamic neurons, which in turn converge at the same striatal levels. Here we show that cholinergic neurons in the brainstem also provide a direct innervation of the striatal complex. By the expression of fluorescent proteins in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)::Cre(+) transgenic rats, we selectively labeled cholinergic neurons in the rostral PPN, caudal PPN, and LDT. We show that cholinergic neurons topographically innervate wide areas of the striatal complex: rostral PPN preferentially innervates the dorsolateral striatum, and LDT preferentially innervates the medial striatum and nucleus accumbens core in which they principally form asymmetric synapses. Retrograde labeling combined with immunohistochemistry in wild-type rats confirmed the topography and cholinergic nature of the projection. Furthermore, transynaptic gene activation and conventional double retrograde labeling suggest that LDT neurons that innervate the nucleus accumbens also send collaterals to the thalamus and the dopaminergic midbrain, thus providing both direct and indirect projections, to the striatal complex. The differential activity of cholinergic interneurons and cholinergic neurons of the brainstem during reward-related paradigms suggest that the two systems play different but complementary roles in the processing of information in the striatum.},

abstract = {As indicated by the profound cognitive impairments caused by cholinergic receptor antagonists, cholinergic neurotransmission has a vital role in cognitive function, specifically attention and memory encoding. Abnormally regulated cholinergic neurotransmission has been hypothesized to contribute to the cognitive symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Loss of cholinergic neurons enhances the severity of the symptoms of dementia. Cholinergic receptor agonists and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been investigated for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction. Evidence from experiments using new techniques for measuring rapid changes in cholinergic neurotransmission provides a novel perspective on the cholinergic regulation of cognitive processes. This evidence indicates that changes in cholinergic modulation on a timescale of seconds is triggered by sensory input cues and serves to facilitate cue detection and attentional performance. Furthermore, the evidence indicates cholinergic induction of evoked intrinsic, persistent spiking mechanisms for active maintenance of sensory input, and planned responses. Models have been developed to describe the neuronal mechanisms underlying the transient modulation of cortical target circuits by cholinergic activity. These models postulate specific locations and roles of nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and that cholinergic neurotransmission is controlled in part by (cortical) target circuits. The available evidence and these models point to new principles governing the development of the next generation of cholinergic treatments for cognitive disorders.},

abstract = {Neural precursor cells actively proliferate in the ventricular zone to self-renew the stem cell population, and in parallel, maintain their undifferentiated state. This progenitor pool generates postmitotic cells that migrate to the mantle layer and differentiate into mature neurons. The growth of these stem cells is strictly controlled by the canonical Wnt signaling cascade, in part mediated by the direct regulation of Cyclin D1, a critical regulator of cell cycle progression. Here, we report that the canonical Wnt pathway directly controls the expression of NRSF/REST. The Wnt-activated $\beta$-catenin/TCF complex up-regulates this gene through a conserved element found in its exon 1a, a critical result obtained by a novel in ovo transcriptional assay. Hence, our data show that the canonical Wnt signaling cascade directly regulates the NRSF/REST and Cyclin D1 genes, thereby controlling the progenitor cells. In addition, we show that our in ovo transcription assay is a powerful way to analyze gene regulation in a natural in vivo context. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The nucleus basalis (NB) of the human brain is a large, complex, and highly differentiated structure. Many of its neurons are magnocellular, hyperchromic, isodendritic, acetylcholinesterase-rich, and choline-acetyltransferase-positive. Concurrent histochemical and immunological staining demonstrated that all choline-acetyltransferase-positive NB neurons in the human brain also contain acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity. Only a small minority of acetylcholinesterase-rich magnocellular cell bodies in the NB failed to show choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity. Sections that were counterstained for Nissl substance showed that 80-90{\%} of all magnocellular neurons in the NB were choline-acetyltransferase-positive and therefore cholinergic. These characteristics, which are very similar to those of the NB in the monkey brain, justified the designation of these cholinergic neurons in the human brain as the Ch4 (or NB-Ch4) complex. On morphological grounds, the compact parts of the human NB-Ch4 complex were divided into distinct sectors which appeared to show a greater level of differentiation than in the monkey brain. In addition to the compact sectors, interstitial elements of NB Ch4 were embedded within adjacent fiber bundles. The putative cortical projections from NB-Ch4 were identified in the form of acetylcholinesterase-rich fibers. These fibers formed a dense plexus in all cortical regions but also displayed laminar and regional variations. Limbic and paralimbic areas had higher concentrations of these fibers than the immediately adjacent neocortical association areas. Alzheimer's disease was associated with a marked depletion of cortical acetylcholinesterase. Two cases of Alzheimer's disease with relatively selective NB-Ch4 cell loss supported the hypothesis that the corticopetal cholinergic pathways in the human brain may have a topographical organization similar to that in the monkey brain.},

abstract = {Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, but no clear disease-initiating mechanism is known. A$\beta$ deposits and neuronal tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau are characteristic for AD. Here, we analyze the contribution of microRNA-125b (miR-125b), which is elevated in AD. In primary neurons, overexpression of miR-125b causes tau hyperphosphorylation and an upregulation of p35, cdk5, and p44/42-MAPK signaling. In parallel, the phosphatases DUSP6 and PPP1CA and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-W are downregulated as direct targets of miR-125b. Knockdown of these phosphatases induces tau hyperphosphorylation, and overexpression of PPP1CA and Bcl-W prevents miR-125b-induced tau phosphorylation, suggesting that they mediate the effects of miR-125b on tau. Conversely, suppression of miR-125b in neurons by tough decoys reduces tau phosphorylation and kinase expression/activity. Injecting miR-125b into the hippocampus of mice impairs associative learning and is accompanied by downregulation of Bcl-W, DUSP6, and PPP1CA, resulting in increased tau phosphorylation in vivo. Importantly, DUSP6 and PPP1CA are also reduced in AD brains. These data implicate miR-125b in the pathogenesis of AD by promoting pathological tau phosphorylation.},

Given the ubiquitous but varying degrees of olfactory dysfunction among such diseases, it is conceivable that differential disruption of a common primordial neuropathological substrate causes these differences in olfactory function. For example, the amount of damage to forebrain neurotransmitter and neuromodulator circuits, most notably those involving cholinergic transmission, appears to be correlated with quantitative smell test scores across a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, a key question is whether damage to such a substrate is the basis for the perceptual differences in olfaction or whether disease-specific or other entities, such as respiratory infections or pollution, are responsible. In light of the early preclinical onset of smell deficits in many neurodegenerative diseases, the answer to this question might provide crucial insight into the cause of disease pathology at its earliest stages of development.},

Objective: To screen out the susceptibility genes on chromosome 6 comprehensively for SCZ, BPD and MDD in a relative homogenous population in China. Method: A total of 56.400 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) on chromosome 6 were genotyped by Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 6.0 on 119 SCZ, 253 BPD (type-I), 177 MDD patients and 1000 controls. Results: Associated SNP loci on chromosome 6 were comprehensively revealed and outstanding susceptibility genes were identified including JARID2 (Homo sapiens jumonji, AT rich interactive domain 2) which plays an essential role in embryonic development and neural tube fusion process. Unexpectedly, flanking genes for all associated SNPs were replicated in an enlarged cohort of 986 SCZ patients. Conclusion: Considering all evidence, our results imply that both of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder are subtypes of schizophrenia. Furthermore, JARID2 is an important psychosis gene in this population.},

abstract = {MRNA translation, or protein synthesis, is a major component of the transformation of the genetic code into any cellular activity. This complicated, multistep process is divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. Initiation is the step at which the ribosome is recruited to the mRNA, and is regarded as the major rate-limiting step in translation, while elongation consists of the elongation of the polypeptide chain; both steps are frequent targets for regulation, which is defined as a change in the rate of translation of an mRNA per unit time. In the normal brain, control of translation is a key mechanism for regulation of memory and synaptic plasticity consolidation, i.e., the off-line processing of acquired information. These regulation processes may differ between different brain structures or neuronal populations. Moreover, dysregulation of translation leads to pathological brain function such as memory impairment. Both normal and abnormal function of the translation machinery is believed to lead to translational up-regulation or down-regulation of a subset of mRNAs. However, the identification of these newly synthesized proteins and determination of the rates of protein synthesis or degradation taking place in different neuronal types and compartments at different time points in the brain demand new proteomic methods and system biology approaches. Here, we discuss in detail the relationship between translation regulation and memory or synaptic plasticity consolidation while focusing on a model of cortical-dependent taste learning task and hippocampal-dependent plasticity. In addition, we describe a novel systems biology perspective to better describe consolidation.},

Amyloid $\beta$-peptide (A$\beta$) accumulating in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients is believed to be the main pathophysiologcal cause of the disease. Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by $\alpha$-secretase ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) protects the brain from the production of the A$\beta$. Meanwhile, dysregulation or aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely documented in AD patients. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-144, which was previously reported to be increased in elderly primate brains and AD patients, significantly decreased activity of the luciferase reporter containing the ADAM10 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed the ADAM10 protein level, whereas the miR-144 inhibitor led to an increase of the luciferase activity. The negative regulation caused by miR-144 was strictly dependent on the binding of the miRNA to its recognition element in the ADAM10 3'-UTR. Moreover, we also showed that activator protein-1 regulates the transcription of miR-144 and the up-regulation of miR-144 at least partially induces the suppression of the ADAM10 protein in the presence of A$\beta$. In addition, we found that miR-451, a miRNA processed from a single gene locus with miR-144, is also involved in the regulation of ADAM10 expression. Taken together, our data therefore demonstrate miR-144/451 is a negative regulator of the ADAM10 protein and suggest a mechanistic role for miR-144/451 in AD pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Rear-end collisions account for approximately {\$}9 billion in medical and damaged property costs annually in the United States alone. These types of collisions account for nearly 30{\%} of all vehicle impacts, making them the most common collision type. Soft tissue injury to the neck (i.e., whiplash) is typically associated with this type of collision. The vehicle seating system is the predominant safety device employed to protect the occupant during a rear-end collision. Currently, designers focus predominantly on seat base strength, seat back stiffness/compliance, and head restraint size and position as a means of mitigating injury. While all of these aspects are important and have increased the crashworthiness of the seat, the concept of utilizing the seat base as a component to further assist in whiplash protection has remained relatively unexamined. The addition of a supplemental safety system to the seat base may offer the potential for reducing injuries in higher severity collisions. This thesis examines the potential for deformable materials, (in this study energy-absorbing foam), to absorb transmitted energy to the vehicle seat in order to reduce the dynamic loading experienced by the occupant. The relationships between the type and geometry of the foam and occupant dynamics, and how they affect potential occupant injury (as assessed using selected neck injury criteria) are assessed and reported. Several energy-absorbing foams currently available have been investigated in order to determine the best foam type and geometry for a range of collision speeds. The results indicate that the time to completely crush the foam, dictated by foam relative density, stress vs. strain behavior, foam geometry, and acceleration pulse, can affect the degree to which injury potential is reduced for a large range of collision speeds. Further discussions of design considerations for implementation of such a supplemental system are also provided in this thesis. Reducing rear-end collision severity with the implementation of this device can potentially lead to a decrease in rear-end collision induced injury and fatality.},

abstract = {Post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs is a widespread and highly conserved phenomenon in metazoans, with several hundreds to thousands of conserved binding sites for each miRNA, and up to two thirds of all genes under miRNA regulation. At the same time, the effect of miRNA regulation on mRNA and protein levels is usually quite modest and associated phenotypes are often weak or subtle. This has given rise to the notion that the highly interconnected miRNA regulatory network exerts its function less through any individual link and more via collective effects that lead to a functional interdependence of network links. We present a Bayesian framework to quantify conservation of miRNA target sites using vertebrate whole-genome alignments. The increased statistical power of our phylogenetic model allows detection of evolutionary correlation in the conservation patterns of site pairs. Such correlations could result from collective functions in the regulatory network. For instance, co-conservation of target site pairs supports a selective benefit of combinatorial regulation by multiple miRNAs. We find that some miRNA families are under pronounced co-targeting constraints, indicating a high connectivity in the regulatory network, while others appear to function in a more isolated way. By analyzing coordinated targeting of different curated gene sets, we observe distinct evolutionary signatures for protein complexes and signaling pathways that could reflect differences in control strategies. Our method is easily scalable to analyze upcoming larger data sets, and readily adaptable to detect high-level selective constraints between other genomic loci. We thus provide a proof-of-principle method to understand regulatory networks from an evolutionary perspective.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was an analysis of antidepressant-induced mood conversions to mania/hypomania occurring in bipolar inpatients treated with antidepressants in the Affective Disorder Unit of the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Warsaw, in the years 1972-1996.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The data for analysis were obtained retrospectively from clinical records. In a subgroup of patients prone to mood conversions, a comparison was done of depressive episodes treated with antidepressants with and without a switch to mania/hypomania as well as the frequency of mood conversions induced by particular antidepressant drugs, especially tricyclic (TCA) versus non-TCA drugs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Among 333 bipolar patients hospitalized in this period, mood conversions were observed in 118 subjects, significantly more frequently in female (44{\%}) than in male patients (25{\%}), and in patients with depressive episode at the onset of illness (80 vs. 40{\%}). Among mood converters, it was found that the depressive episodes with a switch to mania were less severe, shorter, and with shorter duration of antidepressant treatment. The risk of switching was higher during treatment with TCA than with non-TCA drugs (36 vs. 17{\%}), the highest with amitriptyline (42{\%} of treated episodes), imipramine (40{\%}) and clomipramine (35{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that bipolar patients prone to mood conversion constitute one third of the inpatient population with this illness. The switch from depression to mania occurred significantly more frequently during treatment with TCA than with non-TCA drugs. It is hypothesized that anticholinergic activity may contribute to the higher frequency of TCA-induced mood conversions.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {Alcohol and other drugs of abuse have significant impacts on the neuroimmune system. Studies have demonstrated that drugs of abuse interact with the neuroimmune system and alter neuroimmune gene expression and signaling, which in turn contribute to various aspects of addiction. As the key component of the CNS immune system, neuroimmune factors mediate neuroinflammation and modulate a wide range of brain function including neuronal activity, endocrine function, and CNS development. These neuromodulatory properties of immune factors, together with their essential role in neuroinflammation, provide a new framework to understand neuroimmune mechanisms mediating brain functional and behavioral changes contributing to addiction. This chapter highlights recent advances in understanding neuroimmune changes associated with exposure to alcohol and other drugs of abuse, including opiates, marijuana, methamphetamine, and cocaine. It provides a brief overview on what we know about neuroimmune signaling and its role in drug action and addiction. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The active moiety of clozapine, the prototypical antipsychotic drug, consists of clozapine and its major metabolite, N-desmethylclozapine (NDMC). Previous studies have suggested that NDMC may be more important than the patent compound itself for the improvement in cognition in patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine. While the pharmacology of clozapine and NDMC are similar in most respects, NDMC has been shown to be an M1 muscarinic receptor partial agonist whereas clozapine is an M1 antagonist in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesized that NDMC may improve cognition by increasing dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) release in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) via direct stimulation of M1 receptors, whereas both NDMC and clozapine itself would do so by other mechanisms as well, and that clozapine would inhibit the M1 agonist effect of NDMC. In the present study, using microdialysis in awake, freely moving rats, we found that NDMC at doses of 10 and 20, but not 5 mg/kg, significantly increased DA and ACh release in the mPFC and HIP, but not in the nucleus accumbens (NAC). The M1-preferring antagonist, telenzepine (3 mg/kg), completely blocked NDMC (10 mg/kg)-induced increases in cortical DA and ACh release. Clozapine (1.25 mg/kg), which by itself had no effect on DA or ACh release in the cortex, blocked NDMC (10 mg/kg)-induced ACh, but not DA, release in the mPFC. The 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY100635 (0.2 mg/kg) blocked NDMC (20 mg/kg)-induced cortical DA but not ACh release. These findings suggest that: (1) NDMC is an M1 agonist while clozapine is an M1 antagonist in vivo; (2) M1 agonism of NDMC can contribute to the release of cortical ACh and DA release; (3) NDMC, because of its M1 agonism, may more effectively treat the cognitive impairments observed in schizophrenia than clozapine itself; and (4) M1 receptor agonism may be a valuable target for the development of drugs that can improve cognitive deficit in schizophrenia, and perhaps other neuropsychiatric disorders as well.},

abstract = {Protein levels of different acetylcholinesterase (AChE) splice variants were explored by a combination of immunoblot techniques, using two different antibodies, directed against the C-terminus of the AChE-R splice variant or the core domain common to all variants. Both AChE-R and AChE-S splice variants as well as several heavier AChE complexes were detected in brain homogenates from the parietal cortex of patients with or without Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients, compatible with the assumption that CSF AChEs might originate from CNS neurons. Long-term changes in the composition of CSF AChE variants were further pursued in AD patients treated with rivastigmine (n = 11) or tacrine (n = 17) in comparison to untreated AD patients (n = 5). In untreated patients, AChE-R was markedly reduced as compared with the baseline level (37{\%}), whereas the medium size AChE-S complex was increased by 32{\%}. Intriguingly, tacrine produced a general and profound up-regulation of all detected AChE variants (up to 117{\%}), whereas rivastigmine treatment caused a mild and selective up-regulation of AChE-R approximately 10{\%}, p {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, the change in the ratio of AChE-R to AChE-S (R/S-ratio) strongly and positively correlated with sustained cognition at 12 months (p {\textless} 0.0001). Thus, evaluation of changes in the composition of CSF AChE variants may yield important information referring to the therapeutic efficacy and/or development of drug tolerance in AD patients treated with anti-cholinesterases.},

abstract = {The brain uses a strategy of labor division, which may allow it to accomplish more elaborate and complicated tasks, but in turn, imposes a requirement for central control to integrate information among different brain areas. Anatomically, the divergence of long-range neuromodulator projections appears well-suited to coordinate communication between brain areas. Oscillatory brain activity is a prominent feature of neural transmission. Thus, the ability of neuromodulators to modulate signal transmission in a frequency-dependent manner adds an additional level of regulation. Here, we review the significance of frequency-dependent signal modulation in brain function and how a neuronal network can possess such properties. We also describe how a neuromodulator, dopamine, changes frequency-dependent signal transmission, controlling information flow from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus.},

Aberrant expression and function of microRNAs has been observed in AD. Here, we show that in rat hippocampal neurons cultured in vitro, the down-regulation of Argonaute-2, a key component of the RNA-induced silencing complex, produced an increase in APP levels. Using site-directed mutagenesis, a microRNA responsive element (RE) for miR-101 was identified in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of APP. The inhibition of endogenous miR-101 increased APP levels, whereas lentiviral-mediated miR-101 overexpression significantly reduced APP and Abeta load in hippocampal neurons. In addition, miR-101 contributed to the regulation of APP in response to the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-lbeta). Thus, miR-101 is a negative regulator of APP expression and affects the accumulation of Abeta, suggesting a possible role for miR-101 in neuropathological conditions.},

abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic brain hypoperfusion (CBH) causes A$\beta$ aggregation by upregulating expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and $\beta$-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) protein, which is accompanied by cognitive impairment, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated the effect of microRNA on memory impairment in rats induced by CBH. We show here that CBH generated by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) significantly decreased the learning and memory ability in rats, as assessed by Morris water maze, and upregulated expression of APP and BACE1 proteins in the hippocampus and cortex of rats, as evaluated by Western blot and immunofluorescence. In reciprocal, qRT-PCR analysis showed that microRNA-195 (miR-195) was downregulated in both the hippocampus and cortex of rats following CBH, and in the plasma of dementia patients. APP and BACE1 proteins were downregulated by miR-195 overexpression, upregulated by miR-195 inhibition, and unchanged by binding-site mutation or miR-masks, indicating that APP and BACE1 are two potential targets for miR-195. Knockdown of endogenous miR-195 by lentiviral vector-mediated overexpression of its antisense molecule (lenti-pre-AMO-miR-195) elicited dementia in rats, whereas overexpression of miR-195 using lenti-pre-miR-195 reduced dementia vulnerability triggered by 2VO. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that NF$\kappa$B was bound to the promoter region of miR-195 and inhibited its expression. We conclude that miR-195 may play a key role in determining dementia susceptibility in 2VO rats by regulating APP and BACE1 expression at the post-transcriptional level, and exogenous complement of miR-195 may be a potentially valuable anti-dementia approach.},

abstract = {Tauopathies represent a large class of neurological and movement disorders characterized by abnormal intracellular deposits of the microtubule-associated protein tau. It is now well established that mis-splicing of tau exon 10, causing an imbalance between three-repeat (3R) and four-repeat (4R) tau isoforms, can cause disease; however, the underlying mechanisms affecting tau splicing in neurons remain poorly understood. The small noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs), known for their critical role in posttranscriptional gene expression regulation, are increasingly acknowledged as important regulators of alternative splicing. Here, we identified a number of brain miRNAs, including miR-124, miR-9, miR-132 and miR-137, which regulate 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Analysis of miRNA expression profiles from sporadic progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, a major 4R-tau tauopathy, showed that miR-132 is specifically down-regulated in disease. We demonstrate that miR-132 directly targets the neuronal splicing factor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which protein levels were increased in PSP patients. miR-132 overexpression or PTBP2 knockdown similarly affected endogenous 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-132 is inversely correlated with PTBP2 during post-natal brain development at the time when 4R-tau becomes expressed. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies.},

Here, we used RNA sequencing of half a million single cells to create a detailed census of cell types in the mouse nervous system. We mapped cell types spatially and derived a hierarchical, data-driven taxonomy. Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity followed by a secondary diversification. The resource presented here lays a solid foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous system and enables genetic manipulation of specific cell types.},

abstract = {Sweat glands in rat footpads contain a neuronal differentiation activity that switches the phenotype of sympathetic neurons from noradrenergic to cholinergic during normal development in vivo. Extracts of developing and adult sweat glands induce changes in neurotransmitter properties in cultured sympathetic neurons that mimic those observed in vivo. We have characterized further the factors present in the extract and compared their properties to those of known cholinergic factors. When assayed on cultured rat sympathetic neurons, the major activities in footpad extracts from postnatal day 21 rat pups that induce choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and reduce catecholamines and neuropeptide Y (NPY) are associated with a soluble protein of 22-26 x 10(3) M(r) and a pI of 5.0. These properties are similar to those of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). Moreover, the purified fraction from footpads has ciliary neurotrophic activity. Antibodies to CNTF that immunoprecipitate all differentiation activity from sciatic nerve extracts, a rich source of CNTF, immunoprecipitate 80{\%} of the cholinergic activity in the footpad extracts, 50{\%} of the VIP and 20{\%} of the NPY activities. Neither CNTF protein nor CNTF mRNA, however, can be detected in immunoblot and northern analysis of footpads even though both CNTF protein and mRNA are evident in sciatic nerve. CNTF-immunoreactivity is associated with a sparse plexus of sensory fibers in the footpad but not with sweat glands or the Schwann cells associated with them. In addition, in situ hybridization studies with oligonucleotide probes failed to reveal CNTF mRNA in sweat glands. Comparison of the sweat gland differentiation activity with the cholinergic differentiation factor from heart cells (CDF; also known as leukemia inhibitory factor or LIF) suggests that most of the cholinergic activity in foot pads is biochemically distinct from CDF/LIF. Further, antibodies that block the activity of CDF/LIF purified from heart-cell-conditioned medium do not block the ChAT-inducing activity present in footpad extracts of postnatal day 8 animals. A differentiation factor isolated from skeletal muscle did not induce cholinergic properties in sympathetic neuron cultures and therefore is unlikely to be the cholinergic differentiation factor produced by sweat glands. Taken together, our data suggest that there are at least two differentiation molecules present in the extracts and that the major cholinergic activity obtained from footpads is related to, but distinct from, CNTF. The second factor remains to be characterized. In addition, CNTF associated with sensory fibers may make a minor contribution to the cholinergic inducing activity present in the extract.},

The ability to visualize cell biological processes has inspired the development of alternative protein labeling strategies by both chemists and biologists. Among those approaches are the introduction of small bioorthogonal chemical reporters and new fluorescent probes by either genetic encoding or by utilizing the cell's own biosynthesis machinery in live cells. This review will highlight recent advances in approaches to track discrete proteins or whole subpopulations of a proteome including post-translational modifications with spatiotemporal resolution.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (20–22 nucleotides) regulatory non-coding RNAs that strongly influence gene expression. Most prior studies addressing the role of miRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) have focused on individual diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), making disease-to-disease comparisons impossible. Using RNA deep sequencing, we sought to analyze in detail the small RNAs (including miRNAs) in the temporal neocortex gray matter from non- demented controls ( n = 2), AD ( = 5), dementia with Lewy bodies ( = 4), hippocampal sclerosis n n of aging ( n = 4), and frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD) ( n = 5) cases, together accounting for the most prevalent ND subtypes. All cases had short postmortem intervals, relatively high-quality RNA, and state-of-the-art neuropathological diagnoses. The resulting data (over 113 million reads in total, averaging 5.6 million reads per sample) and secondary expression analyses constitute an unprecedented look into the human cerebral cortical miRNome at single nucleotide resolution. While we find no apparent changes in isomiR or miRNA editing patterns in correlation with ND pathology, our results validate and extend previous miRNA profiling studies with regard to quantitative changes in NDs. In agreement with this idea, we provide independent cohort validation for changes in miR-132 expression levels in AD ( n = 8) and FTLD ( = 14) cases when n compared to controls ( n = 8). The identification of common and ND-specific putative novel brain miRNAs and/or short-hairpin molecules is also presented. The challenge now is to better understand the impact of these and other alterations on neuronal gene expression networks and neuropathologies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). The GC skew in vertebrate mitochondrial genomes results in synthesis of RNAs that are prone to form G-quadruplexes (G4s). Such RNAs, although mostly non-coding, are transcribed at high rates and are degraded by an unknown mechanism. Here we describe a dedicated mechanism of degradation of G4-containing RNAs, which is based on cooperation between mitochondrial degradosome and quasi-RNA recognition motif (qRRM) protein GRSF1. This cooperation prevents accumulation of G4-containing transcripts in human mitochondria. In vitro reconstitution experiments show that GRSF1 promotes G4 melting that facilitates degradosome-mediated decay. Among degradosome and GRSF1 regulated transcripts we identified one that undergoes post-transcriptional modification. We show that GRSF1 proteins form a distinct qRRM group found only in vertebrates. The appearance of GRSF1 coincided with changes in the mitochondrial genome, which allows the emergence of G4-containing RNAs. We propose that GRSF1 appearance is an evolutionary adaptation enabling control of G4 RNA.},

abstract = {Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs), the structural domains of the eukaryotic cell nucleus, play a role in cancer and apoptosis, and their involvement in antiviral mechanisms mediated by interferons (IFNs) is proposed. IFNs dramatically increase the transcription of the PML gene. In this study, we have shown that the response of 2 structural PML NB components, PML and Sp100, to interferon-$\alpha$ (IFN$\alpha$) was suppressed in cells simultaneously treated with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (trichostatin A, sodium butyrate, MS-275, SAHA, and valproic acid). Trichostatin A (TSA) blocked the increase of PML NB number and suppressed up-regulation of PML mRNA and protein levels in several human cell lines and in normal diploid skin fibroblasts. Moreover, IFN$\alpha$ induction of IRF-1 was also inhibited by TSA, although incompletely. Analysis of cellular fractions did not show any defects in cytoplasmic-nuclear transport of STAT2, a component of transcription factor ISGF3 responsible for IFN$\alpha$/$\beta$-dependent gene transcription. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that after IFN$\alpha$ stimulation STAT2 binds to ISRE element of PML promoter even in the presence of TSA and thus excluded STAT2-dependent mechanism of TSA effect. These results indicate that the action of histone deacetylases is necessary for the full transcriptional activation of IFN$\alpha$-stimulated genes.},

We propose a method (called SMR) that integrates summary-level data from GWAS with data from expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies to identify genes whose expression levels are associated with a complex trait because of pleiotropy. We apply the method to five human complex traits using GWAS data on up to 339,224 individuals and eQTL data on 5,311 individuals, and we prioritize 126 genes (for example, TRAF1 and ANKRD55 for rheumatoid arthritis and SNX19 and NMRAL1 for schizophrenia), of which 25 genes are new candidates; 77 genes are not the nearest annotated gene to the top associated GWAS SNP. These genes provide important leads to design future functional studies to understand the mechanism whereby DNA variation leads to complex trait variation.},

Pathogenesis and interactions between these pathways have been studied in mouse models. Here, we highlight the fact that axons are important sites of cellular pathology in each pathway and propose that pathway convergence at the molecular level might occur in axons. Recent developments suggest that axonal transport of APP influences beta-amyloid deposition and that tau regulates axonal transport. ApoE4 influences both axonal tau phosphorylation and amyloid-induced neurite pathology. Thus, a better understanding of axonal events in AD might help connect the pathogenic mechanisms of beta-amyloid, ApoE4 and tau, indicating the most important steps for therapeutic targeting.},

In order to better understand how miRNAs contribute to human-specialized brain processes and neurological phenotypes, identifying their targets is of paramount importance. Here, we address the latter by profiling Ago2:RNA interactions using HITS-CLIP to generate a transcriptome-wide map of miRNA binding sites in human brain. We uncovered ∼7,000 stringent Ago2 binding sites that are highly enriched for conserved sequences corresponding to abundant brain miRNAs. This interactome points to functional miRNA:target pairs across {\textgreater}3,000 genes and represents a valuable resource for accelerating our understanding of miRNA functions in brain. We demonstrate the utility of this map for exploring clinically relevant miRNA binding sites that may facilitate the translation of genetic studies of complex neuropsychiatric diseases into therapeutics.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in both brain development and the regulation of adult neural cell functions. However, a systematic analysis of brain miRNA functions has been hindered by a lack of comprehensive information regarding the distribution of miRNAs in neuronal versus glial cells. To address this issue, we performed microarray analyses of miRNA expression in the four principal cell types of the CNS (neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) using primary cultures from postnatal d 1 rat cortex. These analyses revealed that neural miRNA expression is highly cell-type specific, with 116 of the 351 miRNAs examined being differentially expressed fivefold or more across the four cell types. We also demonstrate that individual neuron-enriched or neuron-diminished RNAs had a significant impact on the specification of neuronal phenotype: overexpression of the neuron-enriched miRNAs miR-376a and miR-434 increased the differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons, whereas the opposite effect was observed for the glia-enriched miRNAs miR-223, miR-146a, miR-19, and miR-32. In addition, glia-enriched miRNAs were shown to inhibit aberrant glial expression of neuronal proteins and phenotypes, as exemplified by miR-146a, which inhibited neuroligin 1-dependent synaptogenesis. This study identifies new nervous system functions of specific miRNAs, reveals the global extent to which the brain may use differential miRNA expression to regulate neural cell-type-specific phenotypes, and provides an important data resource that defines the compartmentalization of brain miRNAs across different cell types.},

By employing a comprehensive bioinformatics and statistical analysis, we show that 3' trimming modifications as well as composition of 3' added non-templated nucleotides are distributed in a lineage-specific manner-the closer the hematopoietic progenitors are, the higher their similarities in sequence variation of the 3' end. Furthermore, we define the blood cell-specific miRNA and isomiR expression patterns and identify novel cell type specific miRNA candidates. The study provides the most comprehensive contribution to date towards a complete miRNA catalogue of human peripheral blood, which can be used as a reference for future studies. The dataset has been deposited in GEO and also can be explored interactively following this link: http://134.245.63.235/ikmb-tools/ bloodmiRs.},

A substantial amount of work has shown that mRNA translation in the hippocampus is spatially controlled and that dendritic protein synthesis is required for different forms of long-term synaptic plasticity. More recently, several studies have highlighted a function for protein degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system in synaptic plasticity. These observations suggest that changes in synaptic transmission involve extensive regulation of the synaptic proteome. Here, we review experimental data supporting the idea that protein homeostasis is a regulatory motif for synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {Adipose tissue is one of the main sources of inflammatory mediators, with interleukin-6 (IL-6) among them. Although high systemic levels of inflammatory mediators are cachectogenic and/or anorexic, today it is a widely propagated thesis that in the background of obesity, a low level of chronic inflammation can be found, with IL-6 being one of the many suggested mediators. This paper reviews the studies describing elevated IL-6 levels in obese patients and the role of adipocytes and adipose-tissue macrophages in the production of IL-6. The secretion of IL-6 is regulated by several physiologic or pathologic factors: hormones, cytokines, diet, physical activity, stress, hypoxia, and others. Adipose tissue-derived IL-6 may have an effect on metabolism through several mechanisms, including adipose tissue-specific gene expression, triglyceride release, lipoprotein lipase downregulation, insulin sensitivity, and so on. Having a better understanding of these mechanisms may contribute to the prevention and treatment of obesity.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder that involves disturbances in neural circuitry and synaptic function. The exquisite network architecture and capacity for discreet post-synaptic remodeling of neurons requires coordination by an elaborate intracellular network of molecular signal transduction systems. The redundancy of these networks means that many combinations of gene variants have the potential to cause system dysfunction that manifest as related neurobehavioural syndromes. Recent investigation has revealed that posttranscriptional gene regulation and associated small non-coding microRNA (miRNA), are likely to be important factors shaping the topography of these networks. miRNA display complex temporospatial expression patterns in the mammalian brain and have the potential to regulate thousands of target genes by functioning as the specificity factor for intracellular gene-silencing machinery. They are emerging as key regulators of many neurodevelopmental and neurological processes as their dysregulation could lead to pervasive changes in the network structure during development and in the mature brain that are highly significant in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This review looks at mounting evidence that mature miRNA levels are altered in both the cerebral cortex and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in schizophrenia. It also examines compelling evidence that the underlying miRNA biogenesis machinery and miRNA genes themselves are subject to disease-associated genetic mutation and epigenetic influence. Significantly, these changes in miRNA expression and associated machinery may represent new targets for pharmaceutical development, and the identification of miRNA signatures in PBMCs suggest that miRNA biomarkers of schizophrenia may also provide the basis for new clinical diagnostics. These developments have tremendous potential and highlight the significance of this avenue of research. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an animal model that circumvents these problems, because zebrafish larvae possess a rich behavioral repertoire and an accessible brain. Here, we developed a classical conditioning paradigm in which 6- to 8-d-old larvae develop an enhanced motor response to a visual stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS) when it is paired with touch (unconditioned stimulus, US). Using in vivo calcium imaging we demonstrate that CS and US activate different subsets of neurons in the cerebellum; their activity, modulated by learning two-photon laser ablation, revealed that the cerebellum is involved in acquisition and extinction, but not the retention, of this memory.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies comprise a large group of neurodegenerative diseases associated with the pathological aggregation of tau protein. While much effort has focused on understanding the function of tau, little is known about the endogenous mechanisms regulating tau metabolism in vivo and how these contribute to disease. Previously, we have shown that the microRNA (miRNA) cluster miR-132/212 is downregulated in tauopathies such as AD. Here we report that miR-132/212 deficiency in mice leads to increased tau expression, phosphorylation and aggregation. Using reporter assays and cell-based studies, we demonstrate that miR-132 directly targets tau mRNA to regulate its expression. We identified GSK-3$\beta$ and PP2B as effectors of abnormal tau phosphorylation in vivo. Deletion of miR-132/212 induced tau aggregation in mice expressing endogenous or human mutant tau, an effect associated with autophagy dysfunction. Conversely, treatment of AD mice with miR-132 mimics restored in part memory function and tau metabolism. Finally, miR-132 and miR-212 levels correlated with insoluble tau and cognitive impairment in humans. These findings support a role for miR-132/212 in the regulation of tau pathology in mice and humans, and provide new alternatives for therapeutic development.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Research on miRNAs has highlighted their importance in neural development, but the specific functions of neurally enriched miRNAs remain poorly understood. We report here the expression profile of miRNAs during neuronal differentiation in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Six miRNAs were significantly upregulated during differentiation induced by all-trans-retinoic acid and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We demonstrated that the ectopic expression of either miR-124a or miR-125b increases the percentage of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells with neurite outgrowth. Subsequently, we focused our functional analysis on miR-125b and demonstrated the important role of this miRNA in both the spontaneous and induced differentiations of SH-SH5Y cells. miR-125b is also upregulated during the differentiation of human neural progenitor ReNcell VM cells, and miR-125b ectopic expression significantly promotes the neurite outgrowth of these cells. To identify the targets of miR-125b regulation, we profiled the global changes in gene expression following miR-125b ectopic expression in SH-SY5Y cells. miR-125b represses 164 genes that contain the seed match sequence of the miRNA and/or that are predicted to be direct targets of miR-125b by conventional methods. Pathway analysis suggests that a subset of miR-125b-repressed targets antagonizes neuronal genes in several neurogenic pathways, thereby mediating the positive effect of miR-125b on neuronal differentiation. We have further validated the binding of miR-125b to the miRNA response elements of 10 selected mRNA targets. Together, we report here for the first time the important role of miR-125b in human neuronal differentiation.},

Analysis of a neuropil data set yielded a list of 8,379 transcripts of which 2,550 are localized in dendrites and/or axons. Using a fluorescent barcode strategy to label individual mRNAs, we show that their relative abundance in the neuropil varies over 3 orders of magnitude. High-resolution in situ hybridization validated the presence of mRNAs in both cultured neurons and hippocampal slices. Among the many mRNAs identified, we observed a large fraction of known synaptic proteins including signaling molecules, scaffolds and receptors.

abstract = {While the analysis of the cartilage proteome is important for our comprehensive understanding of the development and disease of this important tissue, several unique features of cartilage present some technical obstacles. Firstly, cartilage is difficult to obtain in adequate quantities for many protein analyses, especially from mice which are otherwise powerful experimental models. Furthermore, the cartilage extracellular matrix contains an insoluble network of collagen II-containing fibrils that are integrated within an abundant anionic network of aggrecan and hyaluronan aggregates. These interacting networks provide a structural scaffold for the covalent and non-covalent attachment of other proteins and glycoproteins. Consequently, proteomic analysis of cartilage requires extraction of proteins with chaotropic agents to achieve and significant protein solubilization. Finally, isolated chondrocytes are phenotypically unstable, which requires rapid isolation of cells or the use of specific culture conditions. Despite these problems, recent improvements in the sensitivity and reproducibility of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) techniques, combined with improved tissue preparation and sample pre-fractionation approaches, have made the proteomic characterization of cartilage tissues possible. Here we review the approaches that have been used and describe in detail protocols for the proteomic analysis of cartilage tissues and cells.},

abstract = {AIMS: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate translational repression of target mRNAs. Accumulating evidence indicates that various miRNAs, expressed in a spatially and temporally controlled that manner in the brain plays a key role in neuronal development. However, at present, the pathological implication of aberrant miRNA expression in neurodegenerative events remains largely unknown. To identify miRNAs closely associated with neurodegeneration, we performed miRNA expression profiling of brain tissues of various neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: We initially studied the frontal cortex derived from three amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients by using a microarray of 723 human miRNAs. This was followed by enlargement of study population with quantitative RT-PCR analysis (n = 21). RESULTS: By microarray analysis, we identified up-regulation of miR-29a, miR-29b and miR-338-3p in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brains, but due to a great interindividual variation, we could not validate these results by quantitative RT-PCR. However, we found significant down-regulation of miR-29a in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. The database search on TargetScan, PicTar and miRBase Target identified neurone navigator 3 (NAV3), a regulator of axon guidance, as a principal target of miR-29a, and actually NAV3 mRNA levels were elevated in AD brains. MiR-29a-mediated down-regulation of NAV3 was verified by the luciferase reporter assay. By immunohistochemistry, NAV3 expression was most evidently enhanced in degenerating pyramidal neurones in the cerebral cortex of AD. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest the hypothesis that underexpression of miR-29a affects neurodegenerative processes by enhancing neuronal NAV3 expression in AD brains.},

abstract = {The development of stimulus selectivity in the primary sensory cortex of higher vertebrates is considered in a general mathematical framework. A synaptic evolution scheme of a new kind is proposed in which incoming patterns rather than converging afferents compete. The change in the efficacy of a given synapse depends not only on instantaneous pre- and postsynaptic activities but also on a slowly varying time-averaged value of the postsynaptic activity. Assuming an appropriate nonlinear form for this dependence, development of selectivity is obtained under quite general conditions on the sensory environment. One does not require nonlinearity of the neuron's integrative power nor does one need to assume any particular form for intracortical circuitry. This is first illustrated in simple cases, e.g., when the environment consists of only two different stimuli presented alternately in a random manner. The following formal statement then holds: the state of the system converges with probability 1 to points of maximum selectivity in the state space. We next consider the problem of early development of orientation selectivity and binocular interaction in primary visual cortex. Giving the environment an appropriate form, we obtain orientation tuning curves and ocular dominance comparable to what is observed in normally reared adult cats or monkeys. Simulations with binocular input and various types of normal or altered environments show good agreement with the relevant experimental data. Experiments are suggested that could test our theory further.},

abstract = {Recent data from genetic and brain imaging studies have urged rethinking of bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) as lying along a continuum of major endogenous psychoses rather than dichotomous disorders. We systematically reviewed extant studies (from January 2000 to July 2015) that directly compared neurocognitive impairments in adults with SCZ and BD. Within 36 included studies, comparable neurocognitive impairments were found in SCZ and BD involving executive functioning, working memory, verbal fluency and motor speed. The extent and severity of neurocognitive impairments in patients with schizoaffective disorder, and BD with psychotic features occupy positions intermediate between SCZ and BD without psychotic features, suggesting spectrum of neurocognitive impairments across psychotic spectrum conditions. Neurocognitive impairments correlated with socio-demographic (lower education), clinical (more hospitalizations, longer duration of illness, negative psychotic symptoms and non-remission status), treatment (antipsychotics, anti-cholinergics) variables and lower psychosocial functioning. The convergent neurocognitive findings in both conditions support a continuum concept of psychotic disorders and further research is needed to clarify common and dissimilar progression of specific neurocognitive impairments longitudinally.},

abstract = {Background: Neuropathic pain is an incurable disease which is defined as a chronic pain caused by a disease or lesion of the nervous systems. Current treatments can provide a long-lasting pain relief only in a very limited number of patients with neuropathic pain. MicroRNA can regulate multiple genes and pathways involved in human diseases. This review focuses on: a) Molecular mechanisms of microRNA biogenesis. b) Targeting, modifications, and delivery of microRNAs. c) Aberrant expression of microRNAs and their potential therapeutic targets in neuropathic pain. d) Potential challenges of microRNA therapy in clinical practice, such as off-target ef-fects, toxicity, delivery hurdles, and target prediction. Results: This review introduces: 1. Canonical/non-canonical pathway of microRNA biogenesis. 2. Viral/non-viral vectors transporting microRNAs into target cells. 3. MicroRNA mimics/inhibitors targeting strategies. 4. Aberrantly expressed microRNAs in different ani-mal neuropathic pain models and their links to underlying mechanisms such as inflammation and ion channel expression. 5. Potential challenges of microRNAs therapy such as off-target effect, pseudogenes, liver toxicity, delivery hurdles and target prediction. Conclusion: Although using microRNAs to target neuropathic pain seem promising, their off-target/toxic effects and delivery hurdles still need to be surmounted.},

Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the role of cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) in REM sleep generation. Selective optogenetic activation of cholinergic neurons in the PPT or LDT during non-REM (NREM) sleep increased the number of REM sleep episodes and did not change REM sleep episode duration. Activation of cholinergic neurons in the PPT or LDT during NREM sleep was sufficient to induce REM sleep.},

abstract = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an angiogenic factor produced in response to ischemic injury, promotes vascular permeability (VP). Evidence is provided that Src kinase regulates VEGF-mediated VP in the brain following stroke and that suppression of Src activity decreases VP thereby minimizing brain injury. Mice lacking pp60c-src are resistant to VEGF-induced VP and show decreased infarct volumes after stroke whereas mice deficient in pp59c-fyn another Src family member, have normal VEGF-mediated VP and infarct size. Systemic application of a Src-inhibitor given up to six hours following stroke suppressed VP protecting wild-type mice from ischemia-induced brain damage without influencing VEGF expression. This was associated with reduced edema, improved cerebral perfusion and decreased infarct volume 24 hours after injury as measured by magnetic resonance imaging and histological analysis. Thus, Src represents a key intermediate and novel therapeutic target in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia where it appears to regulate neuronal damage by influencing VEGF-mediated VP.},

abstract = {An age-associated increase in oxidative damage to nucleic acids, predominantly to RNA, has been recently demonstrated in neurons of human and rodent brains, which may play a fundamental role in the development of age-associated neurodegeneration. Indeed, more prominent levels of neuronal RNA oxidation compared to normal aging have been described in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Moreover, oxidative damage to RNA has been found also in cellular and animal model of neurodegeneration. Oxidative RNA modification can occur not only in protein-coding RNAs but also in non-coding RNAs that are recently revealed to contribute towards the complexity of the mammalian brain. It has been hypothesized that RNA oxidation causes aberrant expression of microRNAs and proteins and subsequently initiates inappropriate cell fate pathways. While less lethal than mutations in the genome and not inheritable, such sublethal damage to cells might be associated with underlying mechanisms of degeneration, especially age-associated neurodegeneration. Of particular interest, the accumulating evidence obtained from studies on either human samples or experimental models coincidentally suggests that RNA oxidation is a feature in neurons of aging brain and more prominently observed in vulnerable neurons at early-stage of age-associated neurodegenerative disorders, indicating that RNA oxidation actively contributes to the background, the onset, and the development of the disorders. Further investigations aimed at understanding of the processing mechanisms related to oxidative RNA damage and its consequences may provide significant insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders and lead to better therapeutic strategies.},

T lymphocyte counts in 65 confirmed and 35 misdiagnosed SARS cases also were analyzed retrospectively. SARS viral particles and genomic sequence were detected in a large number of circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and lymphoid tissues, as well as in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, the mucosa of the intestine, the epithelium of the renal distal tubules, the neurons of the brain, and macrophages in different organs. SARS virus seemed to be capable of infecting multiple cell types in several organs; immune cells and pulmonary epithelium were identified as the main sites of injury.

abstract = {Genetics constitute a crucial risk factor to schizophrenia. In the last decade, molecular genetic research has produced novel findings, infusing optimism about discovering the biological roots of schizophrenia. However, the complexity of the object of inquiry makes it almost impossible for non-specialists in genetics (e.g., many clinicians and researchers) to get a proper understanding and appreciation of the genetic findings and their limitations. This study aims at facilitating such an understanding by providing a brief overview of some of the central methods and findings in schizophrenia genetics, from its historical origins to its current status, and also by addressing some limitations and challenges that confront this field of research. In short, the genetic architecture of schizophrenia has proven to be highly complex, heterogeneous, and polygenic. The disease risk is constituted by numerous common genetic variants of only very small individual effect and by rare, highly penetrant genetic variants of larger effects. In spite of recent advances in molecular genetics, our knowledge of the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia and the genotype-environment interactions remain limited.},

abstract = {Circulating microRNAs, present either in the cellular component, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), or in cell-free plasma, have emerged as biomarkers for age-dependent systemic, disease-associated changes in many organs. Previously, we have shown that microRNA (miR)-34a is increased in circulating PBMC of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In the present study, we show that this microRNA's sister, miR-34c, exhibits even greater increase in both cellular and plasma components of AD circulating blood samples, compared to normal age-matched controls. Statistical analysis shows the accuracy of levels of miR-34c assayed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis: the area under the curve is 0.99 (p {\textless} 0.0001) and the 95{\%} confidence level extends from 0.97 to 1. Pearson correlation between miR-34c levels and mild and moderate AD, as defined by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), shows an r-value of -0.7, suggesting a relatively strong inverse relationship between the two parameters. These data show that plasma levels of microRNA 34c are much more prominent in AD than those of its sister, miR-34a, or than its own level in PBMC. Transfection studies show that miR-34c, as does its sister miR-34a, represses the expression of several selected genes involved in cell survival and oxidative defense pathways, such as Bcl2, SIRT1, and others, in cultured cells. Taken together, our results indicate that increased levels of miR-34c in both PBMC and plasma may reflect changes in circulating blood samples in AD patients, compared to age-matched normal controls.},

abstract = {Luteolin, a 3', 4', 5, 7-tetrahydroxyflavone, is an active compound in Rosmarinus officinalis (Lamiacea), and has been reported to exert several benefits in neuronal cells. However cholinergic-induced activities of luteolin still remain unknown. Neuronal differentiation encompasses an elaborate developmental program which plays a key role in the development of the nervous system. The advent of several cell lines, like PC12 cells, able to differentiate in culture proved to be the turning point for gaining and understanding of molecular neuroscience. In this work, we investigated the ability of luteolin to induce PC12 cell differentiation and its effect on cholinergic activities. Our findings showed that luteolin treatment significantly induced neurite outgrowth extension, enhanced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, known as neuronal differentiation marker, and increased the level of total choline and acetylcholine in PC12 cells. In addition, luteolin persistently, activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt; while the addition of pharmacological MEK/ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) and PI3k/Akt inhibitor (LY294002) attenuated luteolin-induced AChE activity and neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. The above findings suggest that luteolin induces neurite outgrowth and enhanced cholinergic activities, at least in part, through the activation of ERK1/2 and Akt signaling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Finding genes that are differentially expressed between conditions is an integral part of understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. In the past decades, DNA microarrays have been used extensively to quantify the abundance of mRNA corresponding to different genes, and more recently high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is conceivable that the use of RNA-seq for differential expression analysis will increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and address the challenges posed by this relatively new type of data, a number of software packages have been developed especially for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. RESULTS: We conducted an extensive comparison of eleven methods for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. All methods are freely available within the R framework and take as input a matrix of counts, i.e. the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature of interest in each of a number of samples. We evaluate the methods based on both simulated data and real RNA-seq data. CONCLUSIONS: Very small sample sizes, which are still common in RNA-seq experiments, impose problems for all evaluated methods and any results obtained under such conditions should be interpreted with caution. For larger sample sizes, the methods combining a variance-stabilizing transformation with the 'limma' method for differential expression analysis perform well under many different conditions, as does the nonparametric SAMseq method.},

abstract = {Continuous cell lines, SK-N-SH and SK-N-MC, were established in cell culture from human metastatic neuroblastoma tissue and maintained in vitro for 1 to 2 years. SK-N-SH comprises two morphologically distinctive cell types, a small spiny cell and a large epithelioid cell. SK-N-MC is composed of small fibroblast-like cells with scant cytoplasm. In monolayer culture both cell lines form disoriented growth patterns and reach high saturation densities. Population-doubling times were 44 and 32 hr for SK-N-SH and SK-N-MC, respectively. Inoculum levels of 107 cells of both lines produced tumors confirmed by histopathological examination, at frequencies of 30 to 40{\%} in cheek pouches of conditioned Syrian hamsters. SK-N-SH cells are characterized by high dopamine-$\beta$-hydroxylase activity while SK-N-MC cells have no detectable activity. However, for SK-N-MC but not SK-N-SH, the presence of intracellular catecholamine was indicated by formaldehyde-induced fluorescence. The lines are near-diploid with several chromosomal markers; SK-N-MC cells contain double-minute chromosomes. Growth, biochemical, and cytogenetic properties confirmed that the lines comprise malignant cells of neurogenic origin. {\textcopyright} 1973, American Association for Cancer Research.

abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates an activated inflammatory response system as a vulnerability factor for schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). We aimed to detect a specific inflammatory monocyte gene expression signature in SZ and compare such signature with our recently described inflammatory monocyte gene signature in BD. A quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) case-control gene expression study was performed on monocytes of 27 SZ patients and compared to outcomes collected in 56 BD patients (all patients naturalistically treated). For Q-PCR we used nine 'SZ specific genes' (found in whole genome analysis), the 19 BD signature genes (previously found by us) and six recently described autoimmune diabetes inflammatory monocyte genes. Monocytes of SZ patients had (similar to those of BD patients) a high inflammatory set point composed of three subsets of strongly correlating genes characterized by different sets of transcription/MAPK regulating factors. Subset 1A, characterized by ATF3 and DUSP2, and subset 1B, characterized by EGR3 and MXD1, were shared between BD and SZ patients (up-regulated in 67{\%} and 51{\%}, and 34{\%} and 41{\%}, respectively). Subset 2, characterized by PTPN7 and NAB2 was up-regulated in the monocytes of 62{\%} BD, but down-regulated in the monocytes of 48{\%} of SZ patients. Our approach shows that monocytes of SZ and BD patients overlap, but also differ in inflammatory gene expression. Our approach opens new avenues for nosological classifications of psychoses based on the inflammatory state of patients, enabling selection of those patients who might benefit from an anti-inflammatory treatment.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder involving dysregulation of many biological pathways at multiple levels. Classical epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, and regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs), are among the major regulatory elements that control these pathways at the molecular level, with epigenetic modifications regulating gene expression transcriptionally and miRNAs suppressing gene expression posttranscriptionally. Epigenetic mechanisms and miRNAs have recently been shown to closely interact with each other, thereby creating reciprocal regulatory circuits, which appear to be disrupted in neuronal and glial cells affected by AD. Here, we review those miRNAs implicated in AD that are regulated by promoter DNA methylation and/or chromatin modifications and, which frequently direct the expression of constituents of the epigenetic machinery, concluding with the delineation of a complex epigenetic-miRNA regulatory network and its alterations in AD. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The functional activities of the tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) are mostly associated with its nuclear location. In the present study, we discovered an unexpected role of PML in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In PML-deficient macrophages, the production of IL-1$\beta$ was strongly impaired. The expression of pro-IL-1$\beta$, NLRP3, ASC, and procaspase-1 was not affected in Pml(-/-) macrophages. PML deficiency selectively reduced the processing of procaspase-1. We further showed that PML is required for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome in reconstitution experiment. All PML isoforms were capable of stimulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In Pml(-/-) macrophages, the generation of reactive oxygen species and release of mitochondrial DNA were decreased. The involvement of PML in inflammasome activation constitutes an important activity of PML and reveals a new mechanism underlying the inflammasome activation. In addition, downregulation of PML by arsenic trioxide suppressed monosodium urate (MSU)-induced IL-1$\beta$ production, suggesting that targeting to PML could be used to treat NLRP3 inflammasome-associated diseases.},

abstract = {Objective Central cholinergic neural circuits play a role in the regulation of feeding behavior. The dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) is considered the appetite-stimulating center and contains cholinergic neurons. Here, we study the role of DMH cholinergic neurons in the control of food intake. Methods To selectively stimulate DMH cholinergic neurons, we expressed stimulatory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) and channelrhodopsins in DMH cholinergic neurons by injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors into the DMH of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-IRES-Cre mice. We also generated transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsins in cholinergic neurons with the Cre-LoxP technique. To delete the Chat gene exclusively in the DMH, we injected an AAV carrying a Cre recombinase transgene into the DMH of floxed ChAT mice. Food intake was measured with and without selective stimulation of DMH cholinergic neurons. Results Mice lacking the Chat gene in the DMH show reduced body weight as compared to control. Chemogenetic activation of DMH cholinergic neurons promotes food intake. This orexigenic effect is further supported by experiments of optogenetic stimulation of DMH cholinergic neurons. DMH cholinergic neurons innervate pro-opiomelanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). Treatment with acetylcholine (ACh) enhances GABAergic inhibitory transmission to ARC POMC neurons that is blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist. Direct activation of cholinergic fibers in the ARC readily stimulates food intake that is also abolished by the muscarinic receptor antagonist. Conclusion ACh released from DMH cholinergic neurons regulates food intake and body weight. This effect is mediated in part through regulation of ARC POMC neurons. Activation of muscarinic receptors on GABAergic axon terminals enhances inhibitory tone to ARC POMC neurons. Hence, this novel DMHACh → ARCPOMCpathway plays an important role in the control of food intake and body weight.},

abstract = {Microelectrode array recordings of neuronal activity present significant opportunities for studying the brain with single-cell and spike-time precision. However, challenges in device manufacturing constrain dense multisite recordings to two spatial dimensions, whereas access to the three-dimensional (3D) structure of many brain regions appears to remain a challenge. To overcome this limitation, we present two novel recording modalities of silicon-based devices aimed at establishing 3D functionality. First, we fabricated a dual-side electrode array by patterning recording sites on both the front and back of an implantable microstructure. We found that the majority of single-unit spikes could not be simultaneously detected from both sides, suggesting that in addition to providing higher spatial resolution measurements than that of single-side devices, dual-side arrays also lead to increased recording yield. Second, we obtained recordings along three principal directions with a multilayer array and demonstrated 3D spike source localization within the enclosed measurement space. The large-scale integration of such dual-side and multilayer arrays is expected to provide massively parallel recording capabilities in the brain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Categorizing protein-encoding transcriptomes of normal tissues into housekeeping genes and tissue-selective genes is a fundamental step toward studies of genetic functions and genetic associations to tissue-specific diseases. Previous studies have been mainly based on a few data sets with limited samples in each tissue, which restrained the representativeness of their identified genes, and resulted in low consensus among them. RESULTS: This study compiled 1,431 samples in 43 normal human tissues from 104 microarray data sets. We developed a new method to improve gene expression assessment, and showed that more than ten samples are needed to robustly identify the protein-encoding transcriptome of a tissue. We identified 2,064 housekeeping genes and 2,293 tissue-selective genes, and analyzed gene lists by functional enrichment analysis. The housekeeping genes are mainly involved in fundamental cellular functions, and the tissue-selective genes are strikingly related to functions and diseases corresponding to tissue-origin. We also compared agreements and related functions among our housekeeping genes and those of previous studies, and pointed out some reasons for the low consensuses. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that sufficient samples have improved the identification of protein-encoding transcriptome of a tissue. Comprehensive meta-analysis has proved the high quality of our identified HK and TS genes. These results could offer a useful resource for future research on functional and genomic features of HK and TS genes.},

abstract = {The basal forebrain cholinergic complex comprising medial septum, horizontal and vertical diagonal band of Broca, and nucleus basalis of Meynert provides the mayor cholinergic projections to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The cholinergic neurons of this complex have been assumed to undergo moderate degenerative changes during aging, resulting in cholinergic hypofunction that has been related to the progressing memory deficits with aging. However, the previous view of significant cholinergic cell loss during aging has been challenged. Neuronal cell loss was found predominantly in pathological aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, while normal aging is accompanied by a gradual loss of cholinergic function caused by dendritic, synaptic, and axonal degeneration as well as a decrease in trophic support. As a consequence, decrements in gene expression, impairments in intracellular signaling, and cytoskeletal transport may mediate cholinergic cell atrophy finally leading to the known age-related functional decline in the brain including aging-associated cognitive impairments. However, in pathological situations associated with cognitive deficits, such as Parkinsons's disease, Down-syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, Jakob-Creutzfeld disease, Korsakoff's syndrome, traumatic brain injury, significant degenerations of basal forebrain cholinergic cells have been observed. In presenile (early onset), and in the advanced stages of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), a severe loss of cortical cholinergic innervation has extensively been documented. In contrast, in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a prodromal stage of AD), and early forms of AD, apparently no cholinergic neurodegeneration but a loss of cholinergic function occurs. In particular imbalances in the expression of NGF, its precursor proNGF, the high and low NGF receptors, trkA and p75NTR, respectively, changes in acetylcholine release, high-affinity choline uptake, as well as alterations in muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expression may contribute to the cholinergic dysfunction. These observations support the suggestion of a key role of the cholinergic system in the functional processes that lead to AD. Malfunction of the cholinergic system may be tackled pharmacologically by intervening in cholinergic as well as neurotrophic signaling cascades that have been shown to ameliorate the cholinergic deficit at early stages of the disease, and slow-down the progression. However, in contrast to many other, dementing disorders, in AD the cholinergic dysfunctions are accompanied by the occurrence of two major histopathological hallmarks such as $\beta$-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, provoking the question whether they play a particular role in inducing or mediating cholinergic dysfunction in AD. Indeed, there is abundant evidence that $\beta$-amyloid may trigger cholinergic dysfunction through action on $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, affecting NGF signaling, mediating tau phosphorylation, interacting with acetylcholinesterase, and specifically affecting the proteome in cholinergic neurons. Therefore, an early onset of an anti $\beta$-amyloid strategy may additionally be potential in preventing aging-associated cholinergic deficits and cognitive impairments.},

Oxidative stress not only temporally precedes the pathological lesions of the disease but also activates cell signaling pathways, which, in turn, contribute to lesion formation and, at the same time, provoke cellular responses such as compensatory upregulation of antioxidant enzymes found in vulnerable neurons in AD. In this review, we provide an overview of the evidence of oxidative stress and compensatory responses that occur in AD, particularly focused on potential sources of oxidative stress and the roles and mechanism of activation of stress-activated protein kinase pathways.},

abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of non-coding RNAs which found their way into the clinic due to their fundamental roles in cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Recently, miRNAs have been known as micromodulators in cellular communications being involved in cell signaling and microenvironment remodeling. In this review, we will focus on the role of miRNAs in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and their reliability as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in these conditions. CVDs comprise a variety of blood vessels and heart disorders with a high rate of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This necessitates introduction of novel molecular biomarkers for early detection, prevention, or treatment of these diseases. miRNAs, due to their stability, tissue-specific expression pattern and secretion to the corresponding body fluids, are attractive targets for cardiovascular-associated therapeutics. Explaining the challenges ahead of miRNA-based therapies, we will discuss the exosomes as delivery packages for miRNA drugs and promising novel strategies for the future of miRNA-based therapeutics. These approaches provide insights to the future of personalized medicine for the treatment of CVDs.},

abstract = {We present a new technique called “t-SNE” that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset ofthe data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza- tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

L3, also called Lhx8 (L3/Lhx8), is a recently identified member of the LIM homeobox gene family and is selectively expressed in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE). Our previous study demonstrated that L3/Lhx8-null mice specifically lacked cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. In this study, we reduced L3/Lhx8 function in the murine neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2a (N2a), using L3/Lhx8-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) produced by H1.2 promoter-driven vector. The levels of cholinergic markers per cell were diminished without a reduction in the number of marker-positive cells. Intriguingly, GABAergic marker expression and the number of GABAergic cells were dramatically increased in the differentiating L3/Lhx8-knockdown N2a. These results suggest the possibility that L3/Lhx8 is involved in the determination of transmitter phenotypes (GABAergic or cholinergic cell fate) in a population of neurons during basal forebrain development.},

abstract = {Since its introduction, the ‘single-step' method has become widely used for isolating total RNA from biological samples of different sources. The principle at the basis of the method is that RNA is separated from DNA after extraction with an acidic solution containing guanidinium thiocyanate, sodium acetate, phenol and chloroform, followed by centrifugation. Under acidic conditions, total RNA remains in the upper aqueous phase, while most of DNA and proteins remain either in the interphase or in the lower organic phase. Total RNA is then recovered by precipitation with isopropanol and can be used for several applications. The original protocol, enabling the isolation of RNA from cells and tissues in less than 4 hours, greatly advanced the analysis of gene expression in plant and animal models as well as in pathological samples, as demonstrated by the overwhelming number of citations the paper gained over 20 years.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate the longitudinal relationship between body mass index (BMI), a major vascular risk factor, and cerebral atrophy, a marker of neurodegeneration, in a population-based sample of middle-aged women. METHODS A representative sample of 290 women born in 1908, 1914, 1918, and 1922 was examined in 1968 to 1969, 1974 to 1975, 1980 to 1981, and 1992 to 1993 as part of the Population Study of Women in G{\"{o}}teborg, Sweden. At each examination, women completed a survey on a variety of health and lifestyle factors and underwent anthropometric, clinical, and neuropsychiatric assessments and blood collection. Atrophy of the temporal, frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes was measured on CT in 1992 when participants were age 70 to 84. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between BMI and brain measures. RESULTS Women with atrophy of the temporal lobe were, on average, 1.1 to 1.5 kg/m2 higher in BMI at all examinations than women without temporal atrophy (p {\textless} 0.05). Multivariate analyses showed that age and BMI were the only significant predictors of temporal atrophy. Risk of temporal atrophy increased 13 to 16{\%} per 1.0-kg/m2 increase in BMI (p {\textless} 0.05). There were no associations between BMI and atrophy measured at three other brain locations. CONCLUSION Overweight and obesity throughout adult life may contribute to the development of temporal atrophy in women.},

abstract = {MicroRNA-mediated gene regulation is important in many physiological processes. Here we explore the roles of a microRNA, miR-941, in human evolution. We find that miR-941 emerged de novo in the human lineage, between six and one million years ago, from an evolutionarily volatile tandem repeat sequence. Its copy-number remains polymorphic in humans and shows a trend for decreasing copy-number with migration out of Africa. Emergence of miR-941 was accompanied by accelerated loss of miR-941-binding sites, presumably to escape regulation. We further show that miR-941 is highly expressed in pluripotent cells, repressed upon differentiation and preferentially targets genes in hedgehog- and insulin-signalling pathways, thus suggesting roles in cellular differentiation. Human-specific effects of miR-941 regulation are detectable in the brain and affect genes involved in neurotransmitter signalling. Taken together, these results implicate miR-941 in human evolution, and provide an example of rapid regulatory evolution in the human linage.},

abstract = {We have previously identified presenilin-1 (PS1), the active component of the $\gamma$-secretase complex, as an interacting protein of the amyloid-associated enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In this study, we have explored the consequences of AChE-PS1 interactions. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with the AChE-inhibitor tacrine decreased PS1 levels, in parallel with increase in the secretion of amyloid precursor protein APP$\alpha$, whereas the cholinergic agonist carbachol had no effect on PS1. AChE knockdown with siRNA also decreased PS1 levels, while AChE overexpression exerted opposing effect. AChE-deficient also had decreased PS1. Mice administered with tacrine or donepezil displayed lower levels of brain PS1. However, sustained AChE inhibition failed to exert long-term effect on PS1. This limited duration of response may be due to AChE upregulation caused by chronic inhibition. Finally, we exposed SH-SY5Y cells to $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$)42 which triggered elevation of both AChE and PS1 levels. The A$\beta$42-induced PS1 increase was abolished by siRNA AChE pretreatment, suggesting that AChE may participate in the pathological feedback loop between PS1 and A$\beta$. Our results provide insight into AChE-amyloid interrelationships.},

abstract = {A significant fraction of the total immune cells in the body are located in several hundred lymph nodes, in which lymphocyte accumulation, activation and proliferation are organized. Therefore, targeting lymph nodes provides the possibility to directly deliver drugs to lymphocytes and lymph node-resident cells and thus to modify the adaptive immune response. However, owing to the structure and anatomy of lymph nodes, as well as the distinct localization and migration of the different cell types within the lymph node, it is difficult to access specific cell populations by delivering free drugs. Materials can be used as instructive delivery vehicles to achieve accumulation of drugs in the lymph nodes and to target specific lymph node-resident cell subtypes. In this Review, we describe the compartmental architecture of lymph nodes and the cell and fluid transport mechanisms to and from lymph nodes. We discuss the different entry routes into lymph nodes and how they can be explored for drug delivery, including the lymphatics, blood capillaries, high endothelial venules, cell-mediated pathways, homing of circulating lymphocytes and direct lymph node injection. We examine different nanoscale and microscale materials for the targeting of specific immune cells and highlight their potential for the treatment of immune dysfunction and for cancer immunotherapy. Finally, we give an outlook to the field, exploring how lymph node targeting can be improved by the use of materials. Nanoscale and microscale materials can be used as drug delivery vehicles to target specific lymph node-resident cell subtypes for immunotherapy.

A previous study showed that CNTF-treated astrocyte-conditioned medium (CNTF-ACM) contributed to the increase of the calcium current and the elevation of corresponding ion channels in cortical neurons. On this basis, it is reasonable to assume that CNTF-ACM may increase the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in neurons. In the present study, the effects of CNTF-ACM on [Ca2+]i in rat cortical neurons were determined, and on this basis, the aim was to investigate the potential active ingredients in ACM that are responsible for this biological process. As expected, the data indicated that CNTF-ACM resulted in a clear elevation of [Ca2+]i in neurons. Additionally, the fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) contained in the CNTF-ACM was found to participate in the upregulation of [Ca2+]i. Taken together, CNTF induces the production of active factors (at least including FGF-2) released from astrocytes, which finally potentiate the increase of [Ca2+]i in cortical neurons.},

abstract = {This work was aimed to determine if 1,5-bis(4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl)pentan-3-one dibromide (BW284c51), the most selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AchEI), affects the nicotinic acetylcholine (Ach) receptor (AchR) function. Purified Torpedo nicotinic AchRs were injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes and BW284c51 effects on Ach- and carbamylcholine (Cch)-elicited currents were assessed using the voltage-clamp technique.BW284c51 (up to 1 mM) did not evoke any change in the oocyte membrane conductance. When BW284c51 (10 pM-100 microM) and Ach were co-applied, Ach-evoked currents (I(Ach)) were reversibly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (Hill coefficient, 1; IC(50), 0.2-0.5 muM for 0.1-1000 microM Ach). Cch-elicited currents showed a similar inhibition by BW284c51.I(Ach) blockade by BW284c51 showed a strong voltage dependence, being only apparent at hyperpolarising potentials. BW284c51 also enhanced I(Ach) desensitisation.BW284c51 changed the Ach concentration-dependence curve of Torpedo AchR response from two-site to single-site kinetics, without noticeably affecting the EC(50) value. The BW284c51 blocking effect was highly selective for nicotinic over muscarinic receptors. BW284c51 inhibition potency was stronger than that of tacrine, and similar to that of d-tubocurarine (d-TC). Coapplication of BW284c51 with either tacrine or d-TC revealed synergistic inhibitory effects. Our results indicate that BW284c51 antagonises nicotinic AchRs in a noncompetitive way by blocking the receptor channel, and possibly by other, yet unknown, mechanisms. Therefore, besides acting as a selective AchEI, BW284c51 constitutes a powerful and reversible blocker of nicotinic AchRs that might be used as a valuable tool for understanding their function.},

Currently available systems, however, often have limited in vivo functionality because of leakiness, insufficient levels of induction, lack of tissue specificity or prohibitively complicated designs. Here we describe a lentiviral vector-based, conditional gene expression system for drug-controllable expression of polymerase (Pol) II promoter-driven transgenes or Pol III promoter-controlled sequences encoding small inhibitory hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). This system has great robustness and versatility, governing tightly controlled gene expression in cell lines, in embryonic or hematopoietic stem cells, in human tumors xenotransplanted into nude mice, in the brain of rats injected intraparenchymally with the vector, and in transgenic mice generated by infection of fertilized oocytes. These results open up promising perspectives for basic or translational research and for the development of gene-based therapeutics.},

abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine originally identified almost 30 years ago as a B-cell differentiation factor, capable of inducing the maturation of B cells into antibody-producing cells. As with many other cytokines, it was soon realized that IL-6 was not a factor only involved in the immune response, but with many critical roles in major physiological systems including the nervous system. IL-6 is now known to participate in neurogenesis (influencing both neurons and glial cells), and in the response of mature neurons and glial cells in normal conditions and following a wide arrange of injury models. In many respects, IL-6 behaves in a neurotrophin-like fashion, and seemingly makes understandable why the cytokine family that it belongs to is known as neuropoietins. Its expression is affected in several of the main brain diseases, and animal models strongly suggest that IL-6 could have a role in the observed neuropathology and that therefore it is a clear target of strategic therapies.},

abstract = {Importance Many medications have anticholinergic effects. In general, anticholinergic-induced cognitive impairment is considered reversible on discontinuation of anticholinergic therapy. However, a few studies suggest that anticholinergics may be associated with an increased risk for dementia. Objective To examine whether cumulative anticholinergic use is associated with a higher risk for incident dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective population-based cohort study using data from the Adult Changes in Thought study in Group Health, an integrated health care delivery system in Seattle, Washington. We included 3434 participants 65 years or older with no dementia at study entry. Initial recruitment occurred from 1994 through 1996 and from 2000 through 2003. Beginning in 2004, continuous replacement for deaths occurred. All participants were followed up every 2 years. Data through September 30, 2012, were included in these analyses. Exposures Computerized pharmacy dispensing data were used to ascertain cumulative anticholinergic exposure, which was defined as the total standardized daily doses (TSDDs) dispensed in the past 10 years. The most recent 12 months of use was excluded to avoid use related to prodromal symptoms. Cumulative exposure was updated as participants were followed up over time. Main Outcomes and Measures Incident dementia and Alzheimer disease using standard diagnostic criteria. Statistical analysis used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for demographic characteristics, health behaviors, and health status, including comorbidities. Results The most common anticholinergic classes used were tricyclic antidepressants, first-generation antihistamines, and bladder antimuscarinics. During a mean follow-up of 7.3 years, 797 participants (23.2{\%}) developed dementia (637 of these [79.9{\%}] developed Alzheimer disease). A 10-year cumulative dose-response relationship was observed for dementia and Alzheimer disease (test for trend,P {\textless} .001). For dementia, adjusted hazard ratios for cumulative anticholinergic use compared with nonuse were 0.92 (95{\%} CI, 0.74-1.16) for TSDDs of 1 to 90; 1.19 (95{\%} CI, 0.94-1.51) for TSDDs of 91 to 365; 1.23 (95{\%} CI, 0.94-1.62) for TSDDs of 366 to 1095; and 1.54 (95{\%} CI, 1.21-1.96) for TSDDs greater than 1095. A similar pattern of results was noted for Alzheimer disease. Results were robust in secondary, sensitivity, and post hoc analyses. Conclusions and Relevance Higher cumulative anticholinergic use is associated with an increased risk for dementia. Efforts to increase awareness among health care professionals and older adults about this potential medication-related risk are important to minimize anticholinergic use over time.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structure and function of the human brain are subjected to dramatic changes during its development and aging. Studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of brain development and have a significant impact on brain aging and neurodegeneration. However, the underlining molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In general, development and aging are conventionally studied separately, which may not completely address the physiological mechanism over the entire lifespan. Thus, we study the regulatory effect between miRNAs and mRNAs in the developmental and aging process of the human brain by integrating miRNA and mRNA expression profiles throughout the lifetime.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In this study, we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in the human brain across lifespan from the network perspective. First, we chose the age-related miRNAs by polynomial regression models. Second, we constructed the bipartite miRNA-mRNA regulatory network by pair-wise correlation coefficient analysis between miRNA and mRNA expression profiles. At last, we constructed the miRNA-miRNA synergistic network from the miRNA-mRNA network, considering not only the enrichment of target genes but also GO function enrichment of co-regulated target genes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found that the average degree of age-related miRNAs was significantly higher than that of non age-related miRNAs in the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. The topological features between age-related and non age-related miRNAs were significantly different, and 34 reliable age-related miRNA synergistic modules were identified using Cfinder in the miRNA-miRNA synergistic network. The synergistic regulations of module genes were verified by reviewing miRNA target databases and previous studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Age-related miRNAs play a more important role than non age-related mrRNAs in the developmental and aging process of the human brain. The age-related miRNAs have synergism, which tend to work together as small modules. These results may provide a new insight into the regulation of miRNAs in the developmental and aging process of the human brain.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to both neuronal and immune cell fate, but their involvement in intertissue communication remained unexplored. The brain, via vagal secretion of acetylcholine (ACh), suppresses peripheral inflammation by intercepting cytokine production; therefore, we predicted that microRNAs targeting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) can attenuate inflammation. Here, we report that inflammatory stimuli induced leukocyte overexpression of the AChE-targeting miR-132. Injected locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified anti-miR-132 oligonucleotide depleted miR-132 amounts while elevating AChE in mouse circulation and tissues. In transfected cells, a mutated 3'UTR miR-132 binding site increased AChE mRNA expression, whereas cells infected with a lentivirus expressing pre-miR-132 showed suppressed AChE. Transgenic mice overexpressing 3'UTR null AChE showed excessive inflammatory mediators and impaired cholinergic anti-inflammatory regulation, in spite of substantial miR-132 upregulation in brain and bone marrow. Our findings identify the AChE mRNA-targeting miR-132 as a functional regulator of the brain-to-body resolution of inflammation, opening avenues for study and therapeutic manipulations of the neuro-immune dialog.},

abstract = {miR-132 and miR-212 are structurally related microRNAs that have been found to exert powerful modulatory effects within the central nervous system (CNS). Notably, these microRNAs are tandomly processed from the same noncoding transcript, and share a common seed sequence: thus it has been difficult to assess the distinct contribution of each microRNA to gene expression within the CNS. Here, we employed a combination of conditional knockout and transgenic mouse models to examine the contribution of the miR-132/-212 gene locus to learning and memory, and then to assess the distinct effects that each microRNA has on hippocampal gene expression. Using a conditional deletion approach, we show that miR-132/-212 double-knockout mice exhibit significant cognitive deficits in spatial memory, recognition memory, and in tests of novel object recognition. Next, we utilized transgenic miR-132 and miR-212 overexpression mouse lines and the miR-132/-212 double-knockout line to explore the distinct effects of these two miRNAs on the transcriptional profile of the hippocampus. Illumina sequencing revealed that miR-132/-212 deletion increased the expression of 1138 genes; Venn analysis showed that 96 of these genes were also downregulated in mice overexpressing miR-132. Of the 58 genes that were decreased in animals overexpressing miR-212, only four of them were also increased in the knockout line. Functional gene ontology analysis of downregulated genes revealed significant enrichment of genes related to synaptic transmission, neuronal proliferation, and morphogenesis, processes known for their roles in learning, and memory formation. These data, coupled with previous studies, firmly establish a role for the miR-132/-212 gene locus as a key regulator of cognitive capacity. Further, although miR-132 and miR-212 share a seed sequence, these data indicate that these miRNAs do not exhibit strongly overlapping mRNA targeting profiles, thus indicating that these two genes may function in a complex, nonredundant manner to shape the transcriptional profile of the CNS. The dysregulation of miR-132/-212 expression could contribute to signaling mechanisms that are involved in an array of cognitive disorders.},

Saturation isotherms yielded a Kd = 0.28 +/- 0.06 nM and a Bmax of 337 +/- 47 pmol/g protein. Pirenzepine inhibited [3H]QNB binding; inhibition data showed best fit to a 2-site binding model revealing both a high affinity pirenzepine site (34{\%}, KH = 10 nM) and a low affinity site (66{\%}, KL = 1 microM). These results indicate that muscarinic receptors on SH-SY5Y cells may be subclassified as M1/M2 subtypes. Morphological and biochemical differentiation of these cells after treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or retinoic acid (RA) resulted in a decrease and an increase in the number of muscarinic binding sites, respectively. Furthermore, TPA- and RA-treated cells showed a significant increase in acetylcholinesterase activity compared with non-treated cells. However, only RA-treated cells showed significant increase in choline acetyltransferase activity compared to non-treated cells. These findings demonstrate that TPA and RA can regulate both the number of muscarinic receptors and the acetylcholinesterase activity in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.},

abstract = {IFN signaling is mediated by binding of IFNs to their receptors and subsequent activation of Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling pathway. Stimulation of cells with IFN-alpha leads to the assembly of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 transcription factor complex formed by STAT1, STAT2, and p48 protein. IFN-gamma signaling is mediated by homodimeric STAT1 protein. Although these signaling molecules are expressed constitutively, there is also evidence of transcriptional regulation by IFNs. We have characterized the expression of STAT and IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family transcription factors in primary human blood mononuclear cells and macrophages in response to IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma stimulation. We show that IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma rapidly and efficiently enhanced STAT1, STAT2, p48, and IRF-1 gene expression. IFN-gamma induced IRF-1 gene expression more strongly than IFN-alpha. Stimulation experiments in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, suggested that these genes were activated directly by IFNs. IRF-2 gene was apparently only weakly responsive to IFNs in these cells. When macrophages were pretreated with low doses of IFN-gamma and then stimulated with IFN-alpha, clearly enhanced formation of specific transcription factor complexes was detected. This suggests that higher intracellular levels of STAT1, STAT2, and p48 protein may result in enhanced signal transduction for cytokines utilizing these transcription factors.},

abstract = {Cell grafting shows great promise for treating several brain disorders, in particular neurodegenerative diseases in which specific neuronal populations die. Among these diseases, Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurological disorder that has no efficient treatment. HD is a genetic disease caused by the progressive degeneration of striatal neurons and is accompanied by severe motor and cognitive symptoms. In the absence of a specific agent to block disease progression, an alternative therapeutic approach may be to graft embryonic neurons in the striatum to restore the functional integrity of the cortico-striatopallidal circuitry. Cell grafting may also provide a way of delivering therapeutic molecules locally to vulnerable neurons. The idea is to help the host neurons fight against disease progression rather than simply grafting new neurons that will be subjected to a deleterious environment. The grafted cells are engineered to release a neurotrophic factor that promotes neuronal function and survival. These cells are implanted in the vicinity of the cells suffering from the disease. The treatment uses encapsulated genetically-engineered cells overexpressing ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a trophic factor for striatal neurons. The transplantation of encapsulated cells has many advantages compared to standard cell grafting: the method is reversible, does not involve immunosuppressive treatments, and provides trophic support for resident neurons through CNTF delivery. However, this technology needs to be improved further in terms of capsule location, choice of encapsulated cells, and level of CNTF production. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) is a medically and financially overwhelming condition, and incidence rates are expected to triple by 2050. Despite decades of research in animal models of AD, the disease remains incompletely understood, with few treatment options. This review summarizes historical and current AD research efforts, with emphasis on the disparity between preclinical animal studies and the reality of human disease and how this has impacted clinical trials. We provide a mechanism for shifting the focus of AD research away from animal models to focus primarily on human biology as a means to improve the applicability of research findings to human disease. Implementation of these alternatives may hasten development of improved strategies to prevent, detect, ameliorate, and possibly cure this devastating disease. Keywords:},

We discuss various epidemiologic study designs that have been applied to the genetics of the epilepsies including population studies, which provide compelling evidence for a strong genetic contribution in many epilepsies. We discuss genetic risk factors varying in size, frequency, inheritance pattern, effect size, and phenotypic specificity, and provide examples of how genetic risk factors within the various categories increase the risk for epilepsy. We end by highlighting trends in epilepsy genetics including the increasing use of massive parallel sequencing technologies.},

abstract = {Background: Neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders are multifactorial diseases (i.e., involving neurodevelopmental, genetic, age or environmental factors) characterized by an abnormal development that affects neuronal function and integrity. Recently, an increasing number of studies revealed that the dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved in the etiology of cognitive disorders as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington‘s diseases, Schizophrenia and Autism spectrum disorders. Methods: From an extensive search in bibliographic databases of peer-reviewed research literature, we identified relevant published studies related to specific key words such as memory, cognition, neurodegenerative disorders, neurogenesis and miRNA. We then analysed, evaluated and summerized scientific evidences derived from these studies. Results: We first briefly summarize the basic molecular events involved in memory, a process inherent to cognitive disease, and then describe the role of miRNAs in neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity and memory. Secondly, we provide an overview of the impact of miRNA dysregulation in the pathogenesis of different neurocognitive disorders, and lastly discuss the feasibility of miRNA-based therapeutics in the treatment of these disorders.Conclusion: This review highlights the molecular basis of neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders by focusing on the impact of miRNAs dysregulation in these pathological phenotypes. Altogether, the published reports suggest that miRNAs-based therapy could be a viable therapeutic alternative to current treatment options in the future. {\textcopyright} 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract = {Nine human neurodegenerative diseases are due to expansion of a CAG repeat- encoding glutamine within the open reading frame of the respective genes. Polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion confers dominant toxicity, resulting in neuronal degeneration. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to modulate programmed cell death during development. To address whether miRNA pathways play a role in neurodegeneration, we tested whether genes critical for miRNA processing modulated toxicity induced by the spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) protein. These studies revealed a striking enhancement of polyQ toxicity upon reduction of miRNA processing in Drosophila and human cells. In parallel genetic screens, we identified the miRNA bantam (ban) as a potent modulator of both polyQ and tau toxicity in flies. Our studies suggest that ban functions downstream of toxicity of the SCA3 protein, to prevent degeneration. These findings indicate that miRNA pathways dramatically modulate polyQ- and tau-induced neurodegeneration, providing the foundation for new insight into therapeutics.},

We performed large-scale DNA microarray analysis of postmortem brains of patients with BD or SZ, and examined expression patterns of mitochondria-related genes. We found a global down-regulation of mitochondrial genes, such as those encoding respiratory chain components, in BD and SZ samples, even after the effect of sample pH was controlled. However, this was likely due to the effects of medication. Medication-free patients with BD showed tendency of up-regulation of subset of mitochondrial genes. Our findings support the mitochondrial dysfunction hypothesis of BD and SZ pathologies. However, it may be the expression changes of a small fraction of mitochondrial genes rather than the global down-regulation of mitochondrial genes. Our findings warrant further study of the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in BD and SZ.},

We have analyzed the sequence-specific binding of human TFs using high-throughput SELEX and ChIP sequencing. A total of 830 binding profiles were obtained, describing 239 distinctly different binding specificities. The models represent the majority of human TFs, approximately doubling the coverage compared to existing systematic studies. Our results reveal additional specificity determinants for a large number of factors for which a partial specificity was known, including a commonly observed A- or T-rich stretch that flanks the core motifs. Global analysis of the data revealed that homodimer orientation and spacing preferences, and base-stacking interactions, have a larger role in TF-DNA binding than previously appreciated. We further describe a binding model incorporating these features that is required to understand binding of TFs to DNA. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Here we examined induced human neurons harboring the minor alleles of four disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in MIR137. We observed increased MIR137 levels compared to those in major allele–carrying cells. microRNA-137 gain of function caused downregulation of the presynaptic target genes complexin-1 (Cplx1), Nsf and synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), leading to impaired vesicle release. In vivo, miR-137 gain of function resulted in changes in synaptic vesicle pool distribution, impaired induction of mossy fiber long-term potentiation and deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. By sequestering endogenous miR-137, we were able to ameliorate the synaptic phenotypes. Moreover, reinstatement of Syt1 expression partially restored synaptic plasticity, demonstrating the importance of Syt1 as a miR-137 target. Our data provide new insight into the mechanism by which miR-137 dysregulation can impair synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.},

abstract = {Multiple genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). The main neuropathological hallmark of PD is the degeneration of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. To study genetic and molecular contributors to the disease process, there is a great need for readily accessible cells with prominent DAergic features that can be used for reproducible in vitro cellular screening. Here, we investigated the molecular phenotype of retinoic acid (RA) differentiated SH-SY5Y cells using genome wide transcriptional profiling combined with gene ontology, transcription factor and molecular pathway analysis. We demonstrated that RA induces a general neuronal differentiation program in SH-SY5Y cells and that these cells develop a predominantly mature DAergic-like neurotransmitter phenotype. This phenotype is characterized by increased dopamine levels together with a substantial suppression of other neurotransmitter phenotypes, such as those for noradrenaline, acetylcholine, glutamate, serotonin and histamine. In addition, we show that RA differentiated SH-SY5Y cells express the dopamine and noradrenalin neurotransmitter transporters that are responsible for uptake of MPP(+), a well known DAergic cell toxicant. MPP(+) treatment alters mitochondrial activity according to its proposed cytotoxic effect in DAergic neurons. Taken together, RA differentiated SH-SY5Y cells have a DAergic-like phenotype, and provide a good cellular screening tool to find novel genes or compounds that affect cytotoxic processes that are associated with PD.},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence support the theory of schizophrenia (SZ) being a neurodevelopmental disorder. The structural, cytoarchitectural and functional brain abnormalities reported in patients with SZ, might be due to aberrant neuronal migration, since the final position of neurons affects neuronal function, morphology, and formation of synaptic connections. We have investigated the putative association between SZ and gene variants engaged in the neuronal migration process, by performing an association study on 839 cases and 1,473 controls of Scandinavian origin. Using a gene-wide approach, tagSNPs in 18 candidate genes have been genotyped, with gene products involved in the neuron-to-glial cell adhesion, interactions with the DISC1 protein and/or rearrangements of the cytoskeleton. Of the 289 markers tested, 19 markers located in genes MDGA1, RELN, ITGA3, DLX1, SPARCL1, and ASTN1, attained nominal significant P-values (P {\textless} 0.05) in either a genotypic or allelic association test. All of these genes, except transcription factor DLX1, are involved in the adhesion between neurons and radial glial cells. Eight markers obtained nominal significance in both tests, and were located in intronic or 3'UTR regions of adhesion molecule MDGA1 and previously reported SZ candidate RELN. The most significant result was attained for MDGA1 SNP rs9462341 (unadjusted association results: genotypic P = 0.00095; allelic P = 0.010). Several haplotypes within MDGA1, RELN, ITGA3, and ENAH were nominally significant. Further studies in independent samples are needed, including upcoming genome wide association study results, but our data suggest that MDGA1 is a new SZ susceptibility gene, and that altered neuronal migration is involved in SZ pathology.},

abstract = {Disturbances in parvalbumin- and somatostatin-containing neurons, including deficits in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-synthesizing enzyme GAD67 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in schizophrenia, may be related to disrupted pre- and/or postnatal development. Deficits in the transcription factor Lhx6, which regulates parvalbumin and somatostatin neuron development, are associated with GAD67 deficits in schizophrenia. Therefore, we investigated the potential pre- and postnatal roles of Lhx6 in GABA-related disturbances using qPCR and/or in situ hybridization to quantify PFC levels of (1) Lhx6 mRNA in a new cohort of schizophrenia subjects; (2) Lhx6 mRNA in monkeys across postnatal development; (3) GABA-related mRNAs in Lhx6 heterozygous (Lhx6+/-) mice, which model Lhx6 deficits in schizophrenia; and (4) Lhx6 mRNA in GAD67+/- mice, which model GAD67 deficits in schizophrenia. Lhx6 mRNA levels were lower (-15{\%}) in schizophrenia and correlated with lower GAD67 mRNA levels. In addition, Lhx6 mRNA levels declined 24{\%} from the perinatal to prepubertal periods then stabilized in monkeys. Finally, GAD67, parvalbumin, and somatostatin mRNAs were not altered in Lhx6+/- mice, and Lhx6 mRNA was not altered in GAD67+/- mice. These data suggest that PFC Lhx6 and GAD67 mRNA deficits are common components of GABA neuron pathology in schizophrenia. An excessive early postnatal decline in Lhx6 mRNA might contribute to Lhx6 mRNA deficits in schizophrenia. However, a partial loss of Lhx6 is not sufficient in isolation to produce deficits in GAD67 mRNA and vice versa, suggesting that the concurrence of Lhx6 and GAD67 mRNA deficits in schizophrenia may instead be the consequence of a common upstream factor.},

abstract = {New types of small RNAs distinct from microRNAs (miRNAs) are progressively being discovered in various organisms. In order to discover such novel small RNAs, a library of 17- to 26-base-long RNAs was created from prostate cancer cell lines and sequenced by ultra-high-throughput sequencing. A significant number of the sequences are derived from precise processing at the 5' or 3' end of mature or precursor tRNAs to form three series of tRFs (tRNA-derived RNA fragments): the tRF-5, tRF-3, and tRF-1 series. These sequences constitute a class of short RNAs that are second most abundant to miRNAs. Northern hybridization, quantitative RT-PCR, and splinted ligation assays independently measured the levels of at least 17 tRFs. To demonstrate the biological importance of tRFs, we further investigated tRF-1001, derived from the 3' end of a Ser-TGA tRNA precursor transcript that is not retained in the mature tRNA. tRF-1001 is expressed highly in a wide range of cancer cell lines but much less in tissues, and its expression in cell lines was tightly correlated with cell proliferation. siRNA-mediated knockdown of tRF-1001 impaired cell proliferation with the specific accumulation of cells in G2, phenotypes that were reversed specifically by cointroducing a synthetic 2'-O-methyl tRF-1001 oligoribonucleotide resistant to the siRNA. tRF-1001 is generated in the cytoplasm by tRNA 3'-endonuclease ELAC2, a prostate cancer susceptibility gene. Our data suggest that tRFs are not random by-products of tRNA degradation or biogenesis, but an abundant and novel class of short RNAs with precise sequence structure that have specific expression patterns and specific biological roles.},

abstract = {There is considerable debate whether Alzheimer's disease (AD) originates in basal forebrain or entorhinal cortex. Here we examined whether longitudinal decreases in basal forebrain and entorhinal cortex grey matter volume were interdependent and sequential. In a large cohort of age-matched older adults ranging from cognitively normal to AD, we demonstrate that basal forebrain volume predicts longitudinal entorhinal degeneration. Models of parallel degeneration or entorhinal origin received negligible support. We then integrated volumetric measures with an amyloid biomarker sensitive to pre-symptomatic AD pathology. Comparison between cognitively matched normal adult subgroups, delineated according to the amyloid biomarker, revealed abnormal degeneration in basal forebrain, but not entorhinal cortex. Abnormal degeneration in both basal forebrain and entorhinal cortex was only observed among prodromal (mildly amnestic) individuals. We provide evidence that basal forebrain pathology precedes and predicts both entorhinal pathology and memory impairment, challenging the widely held belief that AD has a cortical origin.},

@article{Han1995,
abstract = {All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) has been shown to be one of the most potent chemical inducers of human neuroblastoma differentiation. The recent discovery that the stereoisomer of ATRA, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), binds to both the retinoic acid and retinoid X series of receptors prompted us to evaluate the ability of this compound to promote differentiation of this cell type. Using the LA-N-5 cell line, we have now determined that 9-cis-RA can induce the differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells as evidenced by dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation, neurite outgrowth, increased acetylcholinesterase activity, and reduction of N-myc mRNA expression. In comparing the effects of 9-cis-RA to ATRA, we found that while both compounds induced qualitatively similar cholinergic (versus adrenergic) features in LA-N-5 cells, 9-cis-RA was 5-to-10-fold more potent than ATRA in its antiproliferative and differentiation activity. These results were supported by transient transfection experiments utilizing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) plasmid constructs containing a retinoic acid responsive regulatory element which showed a 2-to-3-fold increase in reporter gene activity induced with 9-cis-RA over that seen with ATRA at pharmacologically relevant retinoid concentrations ({\textgreater} 10(-8) M). Furthermore, we have determined that 9-cis-RA can significantly enhance mRNA levels of the nuclear retinoic acid receptors alpha and beta in LA-N-5 cells. Taken together, these findings have established the ability of 9-cis-RA to induce neuroblastoma differentiation and suggest that this retinoic acid isomer may have better therapeutic characteristics than ATRA.},

We previously reported a 12-micro RNA (miRNA) blood-based signature using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 54 AD cases and 22 controls. Methods We performed validation of 49 AD cases and 55 controls using NGS and also included 20 mild cognitive impairment and 90 multiple sclerosis samples to identify nonspecific markers. Thus, 103 AD cases, 77 unaffected controls, and 110 diseased controls were sequenced. Although the initial cohort came predominantly from the United States, the validation samples were collected in Germany. Results Five hundred eighty miRNAs were detected in the blood. In the initial cohort, we observed 203, in the validation cohort, 146 dysregulated miRNAs at a significance level of 0.05. With 68 miRNAs, the overlap was significant (P =.0003). Likewise, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve values of the miRNAs correlated (correlation of 0.93; 95{\%} confidence interval 0.89-0.96; P {\textless}10-16). Discussion MiRNAs have the potential to support AD diagnosis and patient care.},

@article{Meiser2013,
abstract = {: Parkinson's disease (PD) coincides with a dramatic loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. A key player in the loss of dopaminergic neurons is oxidative stress. Dopamine (DA) metabolism itself is strongly linked to oxidative stress as its degradation generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DA oxidation can lead to endogenous neurotoxins whereas some DA derivatives show antioxidative effects. Therefore, DA metabolism is of special importance for neuronal redox-homeostasis and viability.In this review we highlight different aspects of dopamine metabolism in the context of PD and neurodegeneration. Since most reviews focus only on single aspects of the DA system, we will give a broader overview by looking at DA biosynthesis, sequestration, degradation and oxidation chemistry at the metabolic level, as well as at the transcriptional, translational and posttranslational regulation of all enzymes involved. This is followed by a short overview of cellular models currently used in PD research. Finally, we will address the topic from a medical point of view which directly aims to encounter PD.},

abstract = {Traditional descriptions of the cortical cholinergic input system focused on the diffuse organization of cholinergic projections and the hypothesis that slowly changing levels of extracellular acetylcholine (ACh) mediate different arousal states. The ability of ACh to reach the extrasynaptic space (volume neurotransmission), as opposed to remaining confined to the synaptic cleft (wired neurotransmission), has been considered an integral component of this conceptualization. Recent studies demonstrated that phasic release of ACh, at the scale of seconds, mediates precisely defined cognitive operations. This characteristic of cholinergic neurotransmission is proposed to be of primary importance for understanding cholinergic function and developing treatments for cognitive disorders that result from abnormal cholinergic neurotransmission.},

Ever since the direct observation over a decade ago that spines can continually change size and shape, spine dynamics has been of great research interest, especially as a mechanism for structural synaptic plasticity. In concert with this ongoing spine dynamics, the stability of the synapse is also needed to allow continued, reliable synaptic communication. Various cell-adhesion molecules help to structurally stabilize a synapse and its proteins. Here, we review the effects of disrupting N-cadherin, a prominent trans-synaptic adhesion molecule, on spine dynamics, as reported in Mysore et al. (2007). We highlight the novel method adopted therein to reliably detect even subtle changes in fast and slow spine dynamics. We summarize the structural, functional, and molecular consequences of acute N-cadherin disruption, and tie them in, in a working model, with longer-term effects on spines and synapses reported in the literature.},

MicroRNAs are one of the major noncoding RNAs that function as negative regulators to silence or suppress gene expression via translational inhibition or message degradation. Their discovery has evoked great excitement in biomedical research for their promise as potential disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Key microRNAs have been identified as essential for a variety of cellular events including cell lineage determination, proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cytoskeletal organization; most, if not all, acting to fine-tune gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in a host of cellular signaling networks. Dysfunctional microRNA-mediated regulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many disease states. Here, the current understanding of the role of miRNAs in the central nervous system is reviewed with emphasis on their impact on the etiopathogenesis of sporadic AD.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an emerging class of non-coding endogenous RNAs involved in multiple cellular processes, including cell differentiation. Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) results in neural differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. We wanted to elucidate whether miRNAs contribute to the gene expression changes induced by RA in neuroblastoma cells and whether miRNA regulation is involved in the transduction of the RA signal. We show here that RA treatment of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells results in profound changes in the expression pattern of miRNAs. Up to 42 different miRNA species significantly changed their expression (26 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated). Among them, the closely related miR-10a and -10b showed the most prominent expression changes. Induction of miR-10a and -10b by RA also could be detected in LA-N-1 neuroblastoma cells. Loss of function experiments demonstrated that miR-10a and -10b are essential mediators of RA-induced neuroblastoma differentiation and of the associated changes in migration, invasion, and in vivo metastasis. In addition, we found that the SR-family splicing factor SFRS1 (SF2/ASF) is a target for miR-10a -and -10b in HeLa and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We show here that changes in miR-10a and -10b expression levels may regulate SFRS1-dependent alternative splicing and translational functions. Taken together, our results give support to the idea that miRNA regulation plays a key role in RA-induced neuroblastoma cell differentiation. The discovery of SFRS1 as direct target of miR-10a and -10b supports the emerging functional interaction between two post-transcriptional mechanisms, microRNAs and splicing, in the neuronal differentiation context.},

Despite the fact that many have studied how ACh affects neuronal processing in the mPFC and thereby influences attention behavior, there is still a lot unknown about how this occurs. Here we will review the evidence that cholinergic modulation of the mPFC plays a role in attention and we will summarize the current knowledge about the role between ACh receptors (AChRs) and behavior and how ACh receptor activation changes processing in the cortical microcircuitry. Recent evidence implicates fast phasic release of ACh in cue detection and attention. This review will focus mainly on the fast ionotropic nicotinic receptors and less on the metabotropic muscarinic receptors. Finally, we will review limitations of the existing studies and address how innovative technologies might push the field forward in order to gain understanding into the relation between ACh, neuronal activity and behavior.},

GSK3 also plays a pivotal and central role in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), an observation that has led us to coin the 'GSK3 hypothesis of AD'. According to this hypothesis, over-activity of GSK3 accounts for memory impairment, tau hyper-phosphorylation, increased beta-amyloid production and local plaque-associated microglial-mediated inflammatory responses; all of which are hallmark characteristics of AD. If our 'GSK3 hypothesis of AD' is substantiated and GSK3 is indeed a causal mediator of AD then inhibitors of GSK3 would provide a novel avenue for therapeutic intervention in this devastating disorder.},

Product information Invitrogen ™ TRIzol ™ Reagent is a ready-to-use reagent, designed to isolate high quality total RNA (as well as DNA and proteins) from cell and tissue samples of human, animal, plant, yeast, or bacterial origin, within one hour. TRIzol ™ Reagent is a monophasic solution of phenol, guanidine isothiocyanate, and other proprietary components which facilitate the isolation of a variety of RNA species of large or small molecular size. TRIzol ™ Reagent maintains the integrity of the RNA due to highly effective inhibition of RNase activity while disrupting cells and dissolving cell components during sample homogenization. TRIzol ™ Reagent allows for simultaneous processing of a large number of samples, and is an improvement to the single-step RNA isolation method developed by Chomcynski and Sacchi (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987). TRIzol ™ Reagent allows to perform sequential precipitation of RNA, DNA, and proteins from a single sample (Chomczynski, 1993). After homogenizing the sample with TRIzol ™ Reagent, chloroform is added, and the homogenate is allowed to separate into a clear upper aqueous layer (containing RNA), an interphase, and a red lower organic layer (containing the DNA and proteins). RNA is precipitated from the aqueous layer with isopropanol. DNA is precipitated from the interphase/organic layer with ethanol. Protein is precipitated from the phenol-ethanol supernatant by isopropanol precipitation. The precipitated RNA, DNA, or protein is washed to remove impurities, and then resuspended for use in downstream applications. • Isolated RNA can be used in RT-PCR, Northern Blot analysis, Dot Blot hybridization, poly(A)+ selection, in vitro translation, RNase protection assay, and molecular cloning. • Isolated DNA can be used in PCR, Restriction Enzyme digestion, and Southern Blots. • Isolated protein can be used for Western Blots, recovery of some enzymatic activity, and some immunoprecipitation.

In particular, we claim that network biology will play a central part in the development of novel polypharmacology strategies to fight complex multifactorial diseases, where efficacious therapies will need to center on altering entire pathways rather than single proteins. We briefly present new developments in the two areas where we believe network and system biology strategies are more likely to have an immediate contribution: predictive toxicology and drug repurposing. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia and is also present in bipolar disorder (BD). Whereas decreased intelligence precedes the onset of psychosis in schizophrenia and remains relatively stable thereafter; high intelligence is a risk factor for bipolar illness but cognitive function decreases after onset of symptoms. While in schizophrenia, many studies have been conducted on the development of cognitive enhancing agents; in BD such studies are almost non-existent. This review focuses on the pharmacological agents with putative effects on cognition in both schizophrenia and bipolar illness; specifically agents targeting the dopaminergic, cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter pathways in schizophrenia and the cognitive effects of lithium, anticonvulsants and antipsychotics in BD. In the final analysis we conclude that cognitive enhancing agents have not yet been produced convincingly for schizophrenia and have hardly been studied in BD. Importantly, studies should focus on other phases of the illness. To be able to treat cognitive deficits effectively in schizophrenia, patients in the very early stages of the illness, or even before - in the ultra-high risk stages - should be targeted. In contrast, cognitive deficits occur later in BD, and therefore drugs should be tested in BD after the onset of illness. Hopefully, we will then find effective drugs for the incapacitating effects of cognitive deficits in these patients.},

abstract = {Study objective: To assess differences in gene expression in cholinergic basal forebrain cells between sleeping and sleep-deprived mice sacrificed at the same time of day. Methods: Tg(ChAT-eGFP)86Gsat mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under control of the choline acetyltransferase (Chat) promoter were utilized to guide laser capture of cholinergic cells in basal forebrain. Messenger RNA expression levels in these cells were profiled using microarrays. Gene expression in eGFP(+) neurons was compared (1) to that in eGFP(-) neurons and to adjacent white matter, (2) between 7:00 am (lights on) and 7:00 pm (lights off), (3) between sleep-deprived and sleeping animals at 0, 3, 6, and 9 hours from lights on. Results: There was a marked enrichment of ChAT and other markers of cholinergic neurons in eGFP(+) cells. Comparison of gene expression in these eGFP(+) neurons between 7:00 am and 7:00 pm revealed expected differences in the expression of clock genes (Arntl2, Per1, Per2, Dbp, Nr1d1) as well as mGluR3. Comparison of expression between spontaneous sleep and sleep-deprived groups sacrificed at the same time of day revealed a number of transcripts (n = 55) that had higher expression in sleep deprivation compared to sleep. Genes upregulated in sleep deprivation predominantly were from the protein folding pathway (25 transcripts, including chaperones). Among 42 transcripts upregulated in sleep was the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein. Conclusions: Cholinergic cell signatures were characterized. Whether the identified genes are changing as a consequence of differences in behavioral state or as part of the molecular regulatory mechanism remains to be determined.},

This study examines the association between season of birth and risk for schizophrenia in China, with special attention to geographical region, urbanity, and gender. Using data from China's Second National Sampling Survey on Disability, a large-scale, nationally representative sample (N=2,052,694), this study employs discrete-time hazard models to compare the risk for schizophrenia development for people born in different seasons, and conducts subsample analyses by geographical region, urbanity, and gender. People born in the spring have the highest risk when compared to people born in the winter, summer or autumn. Furthermore, the relatively higher risk for people born in the spring is greater in the southern half of the country, in rural areas, and for women. The findings are consistent with results from a robustness check done among people who were conceived and born from 1955 to 1965, periods before, during, and after the 1959–1961 Chinese Famine. This study supports the presence of an association between season of birth and risk for schizophrenia development and of heterogeneity by geographical region, urbanity, and gender.},

Reducing the stochastic effects of the differentiation process by correcting for cell type composition boosted the SZ signal and increased the concordance with post-mortem data sets. We predict a growing convergence between hiPSC and post-mortem studies as both approaches expand to larger cohort sizes. For studies of complex genetic disorders, to maximize the power of hiPSC cohorts currently feasible, in most cases and whenever possible, we recommend expanding the number of individuals even at the expense of the number of replicate hiPSC clones.},

abstract = {Cerebral cholinergic muscarinic receptors (MR) have been suggested as one of the sensitive biochemical endpoints of the central nervous system altered by developmental exposure to the widespread seafood contaminant methylmercury (MeHg). In adult rats, MeHg has been shown to alter MR binding both in the brain and lymphocytes, supporting the use of MR in blood cells as a surrogate marker of CNS changes. The effects of MeHg have been evaluated on rat lymphocyte MR binding (using [3H]QNB as specific muscarinic ligand) in vivo (after perinatal exposure) and in vitro. For comparison, in vitro studies were also performed on human lymphocytes. Exposure to 1 mg MeHg/kg/day during pregnancy and lactation (from GD7 to PND7) significantly enhanced lymphocyte MR density in both adult and young rats 21 days after delivery, with a more pronounced effect in the mothers (B(max) increase of 139{\%}) than in the male offspring (+49{\%}) and female offspring (+73{\%}) as compared with their respective controls (33+/-4, 41+/-8, and 37+/-4 fmol/million cells), in accordance with the higher Hg levels detected in the adult blood (11.3+/-2.2 microg/mL) than in pups (1.3+/-0.4 microg/L in both genders). A lower MeHg dose (0.5 mg/kg/day) was without any effect on lymphocyte MRs. In in vitro studies, MeHg was an almost equipotent inhibitor of (3)H-QNB binding to rat and human lymphocyte MRs (IC50 values were 4.1+/-0.29, 5.2+/-0.51, and 5.0+/-0.9 microM for total rat lymphocytes, rat T lymphocytes, and total human lymphocytes, respectively). Notably, the IC50 values for MeHg to lymphocyte MRs were comparable to the Hg levels reached in blood (5-50 microM) of the PND21 rats exposed to MeHg. The finding that the MR binding is a target for the effects of MeHg in peripheral blood cells is in accordance with our previous data in brain [Coccini et al., 2006. Effects of developmental co-exposure to methylmercury and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB153) on cholinergic muscarinic receptors in rat brain. Neurotoxicology, in press], and supports the use of this peripheral endpoint as a biomarker of MeHg-induced cerebral muscarinic alterations. The similarity of MeHg IC50 binding data between human and rat in peripheral tissues suggests the possible application of such biomarker to humans exposed to environmental chemicals.},

abstract = {Cultured human neuroblastoma cell lines were assayed for biochemical characteristics of neuonal function. Cell lines studied included LA-N-1, LA-N-2, IMR-32, SK-N-SH, and SK-N-MC. Veratridine-dependent uptake of 22Na+ implied the presence of the action potential Na+ ionophore in LA-N-1, LA-N-2, IMR-32, and SK-N-SH. The time course of 22Na+ uptake and inhibition of uptake by tetrodotoxin supported this. SK-N-MC had no veratridine-dependent 22Na+ uptake. Tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.10.), glutamic acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15), and acetylcholine contents in neuroblastoma cells were compared to those in brain. LA-N-1 and IMR-32 contained 15 and 5 times as much tyrosine hydroxylase, respectively, whereas LA-N-2, SK-N-SH, and SK-N-MC contained only 0.5 to 5{\%} of that in brain. Acetylcholine was present in -LA-N-2 in 15- to 20-fold greater quantities than in brain; other lines had only 10 to 50{\%} of that in brain. None of the cell lines contained glutamic acid decarboxylase. Thus, continuously propogated human neuroblastoma cell lines may have the action potential Na+ ionophore and may be adrenergic (LA-N-1 and IMR-32), cholinergic (LA-N-2), or inactive (SK-N-SH and SK-N-MC). This is the first demonstration of the action potential Na+ ionophore and of acetylcholine production in human neuroblastoma cell lines.},

abstract = {Real-world networks are often claimed to be scale free, meaning that the fraction of nodes with degree k follows a power law k−$\alpha$, a pattern with broad implications for the structure and dynamics of complex systems. However, the universality of scale-free networks remains controversial. Here, we organize different definitions of scale-free networks and construct a severe test of their empirical prevalence using state-of-the-art statistical tools applied to nearly 1000 social, biological, technological, transportation, and information networks. Across these networks, we find robust evidence that strongly scale-free structure is empirically rare, while for most networks, log-normal distributions fit the data as well or better than power laws. Furthermore, social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks appear strongly scale free. These findings highlight the structural diversity of real-world networks and the need for new theoretical explanations of these non-scale-free patterns. Real-world networks are often said to be ”scale free”, meaning their degree distribution follows a power law. Broido and Clauset perform statistical tests of this claim using a large and diverse corpus of real-world networks, showing that scale-free structure is far from universal.},

abstract = {Since 2005, the National Human Genome Research Institute 1 database of published genome-wide asso ciation studies (GWAS) has accumulated more than 5110 entries for over 500 traits. The rapid growth of data repositories has enabled researchers to undertake large studies and meta-analyses, and has increased the power for detection of trait-associated variants. In The Lancet, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) describes its analysis of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 33 332 cases and 27 888 controls distributed among the fi ve major psychiatric disorders in the PGC (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism spec trum disorders, and attention defi cit hyper-activity disorder). 2 The study has combined some of the leading methodological approaches in genetics to examine the possibility of shared genetic make-up for these diseases. The main innovative contribution of the present study is the combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses of the shared genetic features asso-ciated with vulnerability to these fi ve disorders. Reliability of the results was strengthened by an accu rate methodological design. The investigators addressed some typical limitations of GWAS (cryptic population stratifi cation and unknown biological rele-vance of the detected variants) by inclusion of several case-control samples, all of European ancestry, and by corroboration of results by pathway and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. Pathway ana-ly sis might balance genetic heterogeneity bias 3 (ie, the analysis of a whole molecular pathway avoids spurious associations due to simple interpopulation and intrapopulation individual allele stratifi cation) and eQTL corroborated genetic fi nd ings at the functional level; both techniques are crucial to confi rmation of the hypothesis-free results of GWAS. Because the unit of analysis is set to functionally interacting molecules, pathway analysis also reduces the risk of type 2 error.

A subgroup of 8 subjects had arteriovenous differences measured across forearm muscle. Thirty subjects were studied from late morning to early evening; 19 ate a high carbohydrate meal around 1300 h, and 11 continued to fast. We found a greater than 2-fold increase in IL-6 concentrations across the adipose tissue bed [arterial, 2.27 pg/mL (range, 1.42-3.53 pg/mL); venous, 6.71 pg/mL (range, 3.36-9.62 pg/mL); P {\textless} 0.001], but not across forearm muscle. Arterial plasma concentrations of IL-6 correlated significantly with body mass index (Spearman's r = 0.48; P {\textless} 0.01) and percent body fat (Spearman's r = 0.49; P {\textless} 0.01). Subcutaneous adipose tissue IL-6 production increased by the early evening (1800-1900 h) in both subjects who had extended their fasting and those who had eaten. Neither deep forearm nor sc adipose tissue consistently released TNF alpha [across adipose tissue: arterial, 1.83 pg/mL (range, 1.36-2.34 pg/mL); venous, 1.85 pg/mL (range, 1.44-2.53 pg/mL); P = NS: across forearm muscle: arterial, 1.22 pg/mL (range, 0.74-2.76 pg/mL); venous, 0.99 pg/mL (range, 0.69-1.70 pg/mL); P = NS]. Although both IL-6 and TNF alpha are expressed by adipose tissue, our results show that there are important differences in their systemic release. TNF alpha is not released by this sc depot. In contrast, IL-6 is released from the depot and is thereby able to signal systemically.},

Some of our top predictions are supported by published experiments, yet many are entirely new or provide mechanistic insights to known phenotypes. Our results indicate that coordinate miRNA targeting of closely connected genes is prevalent across pathways. We use the same method to infer which microRNAs regulate similar targets and provide the first genome-wide evidence of pervasive co-targeting, where a handful of “hub” microRNAs are involved in a majority of co-targeting relationships.

Young (average age 26) and elderly (average age 70) volunteers injected with either Escherichia coli endotoxin or saline on two different occasions were first designated Enhancers and Suppressors if they showed increase or decrease, respectively, in plasma acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity 1.5 h after endotoxin administration compared to saline. Enhancers showed significant co-increases in plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and paraoxonase (PON1) activities, accompanied by rapid recovery of lymphocyte counts. Young Enhancers alone showed pronounced post-exposure increases in the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), and upregulation of the normally rare, stress-induced AChE-R variant, suggesting age-associated exhaustion of the cholinergic effects on recruiting innate immune reactions to endotoxin challenge. Importantly, IL-6 injected to young volunteers or administered in vitro to primary mononuclear blood cells caused upregulation of AChE, but not BChE or PON1, excluding it from being the sole cause for this extended response. Interestingly, Suppressors but not Enhancers showed improved post-exposure working memory performance, indicating that limited cholinergic reactions may be beneficial for cognition.

This simple synthesis produced a matrix which was exceptionally stable and had the novel property of selectively binding only one molecular form of acetylcholinesterase. Soluble proteins from a variety of mammalian tissues, including brain, adrenal glands, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood, were separated by centrifugation. These contained combinations of acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) and cholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8), varying from a single form of acetylcholinesterase to multiple forms of both acetylcholinesterase and cholinesterase. The edrophonium-Sepharose matrix bound only one form of acetylcholinesterase. This form of acetylcholinesterase corresponded in molecular size and electrophoretic mobility to the unique form found in cerebrospinal fluid, i.e. secretory acetylcholinesterase.

In this study, we analyzed 6-month-old miR-132/212 knockout mice in a battery of cognitive and non-cognitive behavioral tests. No significant changes were observed in reflexes and basic sensorimotor functions as determined by the SHIRPA primary screen. Accordingly, miR-132/212 knockout mice did not differ from wild-type controls in general locomotor activity in an open-field test. Furthermore, no significant changes of anxiety were measured in an elevated plus maze task. However, the mutant mice showed retention phase defects in a novel object recognition test and in the T-water maze. Moreover, the learning and probe phases in the Barnes maze were clearly altered in knockout mice when compared to controls. Finally, changes in BDNF, CREB, and MeCP2 were identified in the miR-132/212-deficient mice, providing a potential mechanism for promoting memory loss. Taken together, these results further strengthen the role of miR-132/212 in memory formation and retention, and shed light on the potential consequences of its deregulation in neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are now over 2000 loci in the human genome where genome wide association studies (GWAS) have found one or more SNPs to be associated with altered risk of a complex trait disease. At each of these loci, there must be some molecular level mechanism relevant to the disease. What are these mechanisms and how do they contribute to disease?$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we consider the roles of three primary mechanism classes: changes that directly alter protein function (missense SNPs), changes that alter transcript abundance as a consequence of variants close-by in sequence, and changes that affect splicing. Missense SNPs are divided into those predicted to have a high impact on in vivo protein function, and those with a low impact. Splicing is divided into SNPs with a direct impact on splice sites, and those with a predicted effect on auxiliary splicing signals. The analysis was based on associations found for seven complex trait diseases in the classic Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC1) GWA study and subsequent studies and meta-analyses, collected from the GWAS catalog. Linkage disequilibrium information was used to identify possible candidate SNPs for involvement in disease mechanism in each of the 356 loci associated with these seven diseases. With the parameters used, we find that 76{\%} of loci have at least of these mechanisms. Overall, except for the low incidence of direct impact on splice sites, the mechanisms are found at similar frequencies, with changes in transcript abundance the most common. But the distribution of mechanisms over diseases varies markedly, as does the fraction of loci with assigned mechanisms. Many of the implicated proteins have previously been suggested as relevant, but the specific mechanism assignments are new. In addition, a number of new disease relevant proteins are proposed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The high fraction of GWAS loci with proposed mechanisms suggests that these classes of mechanism play a major role. Other mechanism types, such as variants affecting expression of genes remote in the DNA sequence, will contribute in other loci. Each of the identified putative mechanisms provides a hypothesis for further investigation.},

abstract = {Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) trigger sterile inflammation after tissue injury, but the mechanisms underlying the resolution of inflammation remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that common DAMPs, such as high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1), peroxiredoxins (PRXs), and S100A8 and S100A9, were internalized through the class A scavenger receptors MSR1 and MARCO in vitro. In ischemic murine brain, DAMP internalization was largely mediated by MSR1. An elevation of MSR1 levels in infiltrating myeloid cells observed 3 d after experimental stroke was dependent on the transcription factor Mafb. Combined deficiency for Msr1 and Marco, or for Mafb alone, in infiltrating myeloid cells caused impaired clearance of DAMPs, more severe inflammation, and exacerbated neuronal injury in a murine model of ischemic stroke. The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonist Am80 increased the expression of Mafb, thereby enhancing MSR1 expression. Am80 exhibited therapeutic efficacy when administered, even at 24 h after the onset of experimental stroke. Our findings uncover cellular mechanisms contributing to DAMP clearance in resolution of the sterile inflammation triggered by tissue injury.},

abstract = {Plasticity is crucial to neural development, learning, and memory. In the common in vivo situation where postsynaptic neural activity results from multiple presynaptic inputs, it is shown that a widely used class of correlation-dependent and spike-timing dependent plasticity rules can be written in a form that can be incorporated into neural field theory, which enables their system-level dynamics to be investigated. It is shown that the resulting plasticity dynamics depends strongly on the stimulus spectrum via overall system frequency responses. In the case of perturbations that are approximately linear, explicit formulas are found for the dynamics in terms of stimulus spectra via system transfer functions. The resulting theory is applied to a simple model system to reveal how collective effects, especially resonances, can drastically modify system-level plasticity dynamics from that implied by single-neuron analyses. The simplified model illustrates the potential relevance of these effects in applications to brain stimulation, synaptic homeostasis, and epilepsy.},

It is anchored within the synaptic cleft by a highly specialized anchoring device in which catalytic subunit tetramers assemble around a polyproline II helix. AChE is the target of nerve agents, insecticides and therapeutic drugs, in particular the first generation of anti-Alzheimer drugs. Both target-guided synthesis and structure-based drug design have been used effectively to obtain potent anticholinesterase agents. In addition, AChE is believed to play 'non-classical' roles in addition to its 'classical' role in terminating synaptic transmission (e.g. as an adhesion protein). It also accelerates assembly of Abeta into amyloid fibrils. Both of these actions involve the so-called 'peripheral' anionic site at the entrance to the active-site gorge. Novel anticholinesterases are targeted against this site, rather than against the active site at the bottom of the gorge.},

However, inroads have been made by the incorporation of intermediate traits (endophenotypes) and of environmental factors into genetic analyses, and through the identification of rare inherited variants and novel structural mutations. Current efforts aim to increase sample sizes by gathering larger samples for case-control studies or through meta-analyses of such studies. More attention on unique families, rare variants, and on incorporating environment and the emerging knowledge of biological function and pathways into genetic analysis is warranted.},

abstract = {Amyloid beta(1-42), a major component of amyloid plaques, binds with exceptionally high affinity to the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and accumulates intracellularly in neurons of Alzheimer's disease brains. In this study, we investigated the possibility that this binding plays a key role in facilitating intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid beta(1-42). Consecutive section immunohistochemistry and digital imaging were used to reveal the spatial relationship between amyloid beta(1-42) and the alpha 7 receptor in affected neurons of Alzheimer's disease brains. Results showed that neurons containing substantial intracellular accumulations of amyloid beta(1-42) invariably express relatively high levels of the alpha 7 receptor. Furthermore, this receptor is highly co-localized with amyloid beta(1-42) within neurons of Alzheimer's disease brains. To experimentally test the possibility that the binding interaction between exogenous amyloid beta(1-42) and the alpha 7 receptor facilitates internalization and intracellular accumulation of amyloid beta(1-42) in Alzheimer's disease brains, we studied the fate of exogenous amyloid beta(1-42) and its interaction with the alpha 7 receptor in vitro using cultured, transfected neuroblastoma cells that express elevated levels of this receptor. Transfected cells exhibited rapid binding, internalization and accumulation of exogenous amyloid beta(1-42), but not amyloid beta(1-40). Furthermore, the rate and extent of amyloid beta(1-42) internalization was related directly to the alpha 7 receptor protein level, since (1) the rate of amyloid beta(1-42) accumulation was much lower in untransfected cells that express much lower levels of this receptor and (2) internalization was effectively blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin, an alpha 7 receptor antagonist. As in neurons of Alzheimer's disease brains, the alpha 7 receptor in transfected cells was precisely co-localized with amyloid beta(1-42) in prominent intracellular aggregates. Internalization of amyloid beta(1-42) in transfected cells was blocked by phenylarsine oxide, an inhibitor of endocytosis. We suggest that the intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid beta(1-42) in Alzheimer's disease brains occurs predominantly in neurons that express the alpha 7 receptor. In addition, internalization of amyloid beta(1-42) may be facilitated by the high-affinity binding of amyloid beta(1-42) to the alpha 7 receptor on neuronal cell surfaces, followed by endocytosis of the resulting complex. This provides a plausible explanation for the selective vulnerability of neurons expressing the alpha 7 receptor in Alzheimer's disease brains and for the fact that amyloid beta(1-42) is the dominant amyloid beta peptide species in intracellular accumulations and amyloid plaques.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been successful at identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) highly associated with common traits; however, a great deal of the heritable variation associated with common traits remains unaccounted for within the genome. Genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) is a statistical method that applies a linear mixed model to estimate phenotypic variance of complex traits explained by genome-wide SNPs, including those not associated with the trait in a GWAS. We applied GCTA to 8 cohorts containing 7096 case and 19 455 control individuals of European ancestry in order to examine the missing heritability present in Parkinson's disease (PD). We meta-analyzed our initial results to produce robust heritability estimates for PD types across cohorts. Our results identify 27{\%} (95{\%} CI 17-38, P = 8.08E - 08) phenotypic variance associated with all types of PD, 15{\%} (95{\%} CI -0.2 to 33, P = 0.09) phenotypic variance associated with early-onset PD and 31{\%} (95{\%} CI 17-44, P = 1.34E - 05) phenotypic variance associated with late-onset PD. This is a substantial increase from the genetic variance identified by top GWAS hits alone (between 3 and 5{\%}) and indicates there are substantially more risk loci to be identified. Our results suggest that although GWASs are a useful tool in identifying the most common variants associated with complex disease, a great deal of common variants of small effect remain to be discovered.},

The clinical picture was officially recognized and called Minamata disease (MD) in 1956. However, 50 years later there are still arguments about the definition of MD in terms of clinical symptoms and extent of lesions. We provide a historical review of this epidemic and an update of the problem of MeHg toxicity. Since MeHg dispersed from Minamata to the Shiranui Sea, residents living around the sea were exposed to low-dose MeHg through fish consumption for about 20 years (at least from 1950 to 1968). These patients with chronic MeHg poisoning continue to complain of distal paresthesias of the extremities and the lips even 30 years after cessation of exposure to MeHg. Based on findings in these patients the symptoms and lesions in MeHg poisoning are reappraised. The persisting somatosensory disorders after discontinuation of exposure to MeHg were induced by diffuse damage to the somatosensory cortex, but not by damage to the peripheral nervous system, as previously believed.},

abstract = {Two clonal immortalized neurons designated SN6.1b and SN6.2a were isolated by limiting dilution from a mouse embryonic septal cholinergic neuronal hybrid cell line SN6 (Hammond et al., 1986). In the serum-containing medium without extra differentiating agents, one-third of SN6.1b cells stably exhibited a morphology of differentiated neurons with extensive elaborate neurites, while a majority of SN6.2a cells, along with the parent cell line SN6, were round in shape with poorly branched short processes. Neurochemical studies showed that both clones synthesized choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and glutamate.

The coexistence of cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmitter markers in the clonal hybrid septal neurons that express a variety of immunocytochemical properties of differentiated neurons suggests that embryonic septal cholinergic neurons are potentially multiphenotypic with respect to neurotransmitter synthesis.},

abstract = {Forkhead box, class O (FoxO) transcription factors are inhibited by insulin-induced FoxO phosphorylation. Recently, acetylation of FoxO factors by calcium response element-binding (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and/or p300 has been identified as a novel regulatory pathway, although the exact consequences of acetylation remain unclear. We propose that binding of CBP/p300 to FoxO factors is essential for FoxO-mediated transcription. CBP and p300 act as FoxO cofactors by weakening histone-DNA interactions. Acetylation of FoxO factors, however, attenuates FoxO-mediated transcriptional activity by disrupting the interaction between FoxO factors and target DNA. Therefore, acetylation shifts the function of FoxO from cell-cycle arrest and protection against oxidative stress towards cell death.},

Reducing the activity of lin-4 shortened life span and accelerated tissue aging, whereas overexpressing lin-4 or reducing the activity of lin-14 extended life span. Lifespan extension conferred by a reduction in lin-14 was dependent on the DAF-16 and HSF-1 transcription factors, suggesting that the lin-4-lin-14 pair affects life span through the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 pathway.

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional gene expression regulators, playing key roles in neuronal development, plasticity and disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the presence of protein inclusions or Lewy bodies and a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. Here, we have evaluated miRNA expression deregulation in PD brain samples. MiRNA expression profiling revealed decreased expression of miR-34b and miR-34c in brain areas with variable neuropathological affectation at clinical (motor) stages (Braak stages 4 and 5) of the disease, including the amygdala, frontal cortex, substantia nigra and cerebellum. Furthermore, misregulation of miR-34b/c was detected in pre-motor stages (stages 1-3) of the disease, and thus in cases that did not receive any PD-related treatment during life. Depletion of miR-34b or miR-34c in differentiated SH-SY5Y dopaminergic neuronal cells resulted in a moderate reduction in cell viability that was accompanied by altered mitochondrial function and dynamics, oxidative stress and reduction in total cellular adenosin triphosphate content. MiR-34b/c downregulation was coupled to a decrease in the expression of DJ1 and Parkin, two proteins associated to familial forms of PD that also have a role in idiopathic cases. Accordingly, DJ1 and Parkin expression was reduced in PD brain samples displaying strong miR-34b/c downregulation. We propose that early deregulation of miR-34b/c in PD triggers downstream transcriptome alterations underlying mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which ultimately compromise cell viability. A better understanding of the cellular pathways controlling and/or controlled by miR-34b/c should allow identification of targets for development of therapeutic approaches.},

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity of the LA-N-1 cells was increased in the RA-treated cells compared with control cultures at day 4 and remained elevated. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the LA-N-2 cells gradually increased until 8 days in vitro (DIV) both in the untreated control and the RA treated cultures. This activity in control and treated cells decreased gradually to a constant level of activity. The ChAT activity at 8 DIV of RA-treated LA-N-2 cells was increased 2.1-fold (P less than 0.001) as compared to the control cultures. This increase in ChAT activity was accompanied by a 73{\%} decrease of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in LA-N-2 cells by 8 DIV. AChE activity of LA-N-1 cells was unchanged during the time course of the experiment. Phospholipase-A2 (PL-A2) activity in RA-treated LA-N-2 cells was increased at day 4 as compared with the control cultures.

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) deficiency has been linked recently to early Alzheimer disease (AD), but the mechanism by which GRK5 deficiency may contribute to AD pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we report that overexpression of dominant negative mutant of GRK5 (dnGRK5) in a cholinergic neuronal cell line led to decreased acetylcholine (ACh) release. This reduction was fully corrected by pertussis toxin, atropine (a nonselective muscarinic antagonist), or methoctramine (a selective M2/M4 muscarinic receptor antagonist). Consistent with results in cultured cells, high potassium-evoked ACh release in hippocampal slices from young GRK5 knock-out mice was significantly reduced compared with wild type littermates, and this reduced ACh release was also fully corrected by methoctramine. In addition, following treatment with the nonselective muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M, M2, and M4 receptors underwent significantly reduced internalization in GRK5KO slices compared with wild type slices, as assessed by plasma membrane retention of receptor immunoreactivity, whereas M1 receptor internalization was not affected by loss of GRK5 expression. Moreover, Western blotting revealed no synaptic or cholinergic degenerative changes in young GRK5 knock-out mice. Altogether, these results suggest that GRK5 deficiency leads to a reduced hippocampal ACh release and cholinergic hypofunction by selective impairment of desensitization of presynaptic M2/M4 autoreceptors. Because this nonstructural cholinergic hypofunction precedes the hippocampal cholinergic hypofunction associated with structural cholinergic degeneration and cognitive decline in aged GRK5 knock-out mice, this nonstructural alteration may be an early event contributing to cholinergic degeneration in AD.},

The acute response to endotoxemia includes activation of innate immune mechanisms as well as changes in autonomic nervous activity. The autonomic nervous system and the inflammatory response are intimately linked and sympathetic and vagal nerves are thought to have anti-inflammation functions. The basic functional circuit between vagus nerve and inflammatory response was identified and the neuroimmunomodulation loop was called cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Unique function of vagus nerve in the anti-inflammatory reflex arc was found in many experimental and pre-clinical studies. They brought evidence on the cholinergic signaling interacting with systemic and local inflammation, particularly suppressing immune cells function. Pharmacolo-gical/electrical modulation of vagal activity suppressed TNF-$\alpha$ and other proinflammatory cytokines production and had beneficial therapeutic effects. Many questions related to mapping, linking and targeting of vagal-immune interactions have been elucidated and brought understanding of its basic physiology and provided the initial support for development of Tracey´s inflammatory reflex. This review summarizes and critically assesses the current knowledge defining cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway with main focus on studies employing an experimental approach and emphasizes the potential of modulation of vagally-mediated anti-inflammatory pathway in the treatment strategies.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Currently, there are no blood-based biomarkers with clinical utility for acute ischemic stroke (IS). MicroRNAs show promise as disease markers because of their cell type-specific expression patterns and stability in peripheral blood. OBJECTIVE: To identify circulating microRNAs associated with acute IS, determine their temporal course up to 90 days post-stroke, and explore their utility as an early diagnostic marker. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used RNA sequencing to study expression changes of circulating microRNAs in a discovery sample of 20 patients with IS and 20 matched healthy control subjects. We further applied quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in independent samples for validation (40 patients with IS and 40 matched controls), replication (200 patients with IS, 100 healthy control subjects), and in 72 patients with transient ischemic attacks. Sampling of patient plasma was done immediately upon hospital arrival. We identified, validated, and replicated 3 differentially expressed microRNAs, which were upregulated in patients with IS compared with both healthy control subjects (miR-125a-5p [1.8-fold; P=1.5x10-6], miR-125b-5p [2.5-fold; P=5.6x10-6], and miR-143-3p [4.8-fold; P=7.8x10-9]) and patients with transient ischemic attack (miR-125a-5p: P=0.003; miR-125b-5p: P=0.003; miR-143-3p: P=0.005). Longitudinal analysis of expression levels up to 90 days after stroke revealed a normalization to control levels for miR-125b-5p and miR-143-3p starting at day 2 while miR-125a-5p remained elevated. Levels of all 3 microRNAs depended on platelet numbers in a platelet spike-in experiment but were unaffected by chemical hypoxia in Neuro2a cells and in experimental stroke models. In a random forest classification, miR-125a-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-143-3p differentiated between healthy control subjects and patients with IS with an area under the curve of 0.90 (sensitivity: 85.6{\%}; specificity: 76.3{\%}), which was superior to multimodal cranial computed tomography obtained for routine diagnostics (sensitivity: 72.5{\%}) and previously reported biomarkers of acute IS (neuron-specific enolase: area under the curve=0.69; interleukin 6: area under the curve=0.82). CONCLUSIONS: A set of circulating microRNAs (miR-125a-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-143-3p) associates with acute IS and might have clinical utility as an early diagnostic marker.},

Following induction with RA, the neural crest-like LA-N-5 cells undergo differentiation into cholinergic neurons with increased expression of a variety of neural-specific markers including neurofilaments, growth associated protein-43, tetanus toxin binding sites, receptors for neurotrophic factors, neuropeptides, choline acetyl transferase, vesicular acetylcholine transporter, and acetylcholinesterase with a concomitant decrease in the expression of non-neuronal markers. These results provide the basis for the use of retinoic acid-induced differentiation of LA-N-5 cells as a model system to study molecular events associated with the differentiation of cholinergic neurons.},

This review considers how TFs are identified and functionally characterized, principally through the lens of a catalog of over 1,600 likely human TFs and binding motifs for two-thirds of them. Major classes of human TFs differ markedly in their evolutionary trajectories and expression patterns, underscoring distinct functions. TFs likewise underlie many different aspects of human physiology, disease, and variation, highlighting the importance of continued effort to understand TF-mediated gene regulation. Knowing how and where transcription factors bind to the genome is crucial for understanding how they control gene expression.

abstract = {Learning causes a change in how information is processed by neuronal circuits. Whereas synaptic plasticity, an important cellular mechanism, has been studied in great detail, we know much less about how learning is implemented at the level of neuronal circuits and, in particular, how interactions between distinct types of neurons within local networks contribute to the process of learning. Here we show that acquisition of associative fear memories depends on the recruitment of a disinhibitory microcircuit in the mouse auditory cortex. Fear-conditioning-associated disinhibition in auditory cortex is driven by foot-shock-mediated cholinergic activation of layer 1 interneurons, in turn generating inhibition of layer 2/3 parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Importantly, pharmacological or optogenetic block of pyramidal neuron disinhibition abolishes fear learning. Together, these data demonstrate that stimulus convergence in the auditory cortex is necessary for associative fear learning to complex tones, define the circuit elements mediating this convergence and suggest that layer-1-mediated disinhibition is an important mechanism underlying learning and information processing in neocortical circuits.},

The enzyme is involved in the terminal breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, but non-enzymatic roles have also been described for the entire AChE molecule and its isolated C-terminal sequences. These non-cholinergic functions have been attributed to both the developmental and degenerative situation: the major form of AChE present in these conditions is monomeric. Moreover, AChE has been shown to lose its typical characteristic of substrate inhibition in both development and degeneration. This study characterizes a form of AChE truncated after amino acid 548 (T548-AChE), whose truncation site is homologue to that of a physiological form of T-AChE detected in fetal bovine serum that has lost its C-terminal moiety supposedly due to proteolytic cleavage. Peptide sequences covered by this C-terminal sequence have been shown to be crucially involved in both developmental and degenerative mechanisms in vitro. Numerous studies have addressed the structure-function relationship of the AChE C-terminus with T548-AChE representing one of the most frequently studied forms of truncated AChE. In this study, we provide new insight into the understanding of the functional characteristics that T548-AChE acquires in solution: T548-AChE is incubated with agents of varying net charge and molecular weight. Together with kinetic studies and an analysis of different molecular forms and aggregation states of T548-AChE, we show that the enzymatic activity of T548-AChE, an enzyme verging at its catalytic limit is, nonetheless, apparently enhanced by up to 800{\%}. We demonstrate, first, how the activity of T548-AChE can be enhanced through agents that contain highly positive charged moieties. Moreover, the un-competitive mechanism of activity enhancement most likely involves the peripheral anionic site of AChE that is reflected in delayed substrate inhibition being observed for activity enhanced T548-AChE. The data provides evidence towards a mechanistic and functional link between the form of AChE unique to both development and degeneration and a C-terminal peptide of T-AChE acting under those conditions.},

abstract = {The differential diagnosis of Parkinson's diseases (PD) is challenging, especially in the early stages of the disease. We developed a microRNA profiling strategy for exosomal miRNAs isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in PD and AD. Sixteen exosomal miRNAs were up regulated and 11 miRNAs were under regulated significantly in PD CSF when compared with those in healthy controls (relative fold {\textgreater} 2, p {\textless} 0.05). MiR-1 and miR-19b-3p were validated and significantly reduced in independent samples. While miR-153, miR-409-3p, miR-10a-5p, and let-7g-3p were significantly over expressed in PD CSF exosome. Bioinformatic analysis by DIANA-mirPath demonstrated that Neurotrophin signaling, mTOR signaling, Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, Dopaminergic synapse, and Glutamatergic synapse were the most prominent pathways enriched in quantiles with PD miRNA patterns. Messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts [amyloid precursor protein (APP), $\alpha$-synuclein ($\alpha$-syn), Tau, neurofilament light gene (NF-L), DJ-1/PARK7, Fractalkine and Neurosin] and long non-coding RNAs (RP11-462G22.1 and PCA3) were differentially expressed in CSF exosomes in PD and AD patients. These data demonstrated that CSF exosomal RNA molecules are reliable biomarkers with fair robustness in regard to specificity and sensitivity in differentiating PD from healthy and diseased (AD) controls.},

These small RNAs have been shown to contribute to the control of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, important features related to cancer development and progression. In fact, recent studies have shown the utility of microRNAs as cancer-related biomarkers. This is due to the finding that microRNAs display altered expression profiles in cancers versus normal tissue. In addition, microRNAs have been associated with cancer progression. In this review, the mechanisms to alter microRNA expression and their relation to cancer will be addressed. Moreover, the potential application of microRNAs in clinical settings will also be highlighted.

Consensus NRSEs have been identified in 18 neuron-specific genes. Complementary DNA clones encoding a functional fragment of NRSF were isolated and found to encode a novel protein containing eight noncanonical zinc fingers. Expression of NRSF mRNA was detected in most nonneuronal tissues at several developmental stages. In the nervous system, NRSF mRNA was detected in undifferentiated neuronal progenitors, but not in differentiated neurons. NRSF represents the first example of a vertebrate silencer protein that potentially regulates a large battery of cell type-specific genes, and therefore may function as a master negative regulator of neurogenesis.},

abstract = {Infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute CNS injury. It has recently become clear that CNS injury significantly increases susceptibility to infection by brain-specific mechanisms: CNS injury induces a disturbance of the normally well balanced interplay between the immune system and the CNS. As a result, CNS injury leads to secondary immunodeficiency - CNS injury-induced immunodepression (CIDS) - and infection. CIDS might serve as a model for the study of the mechanisms and mediators of brain control over immunity. More importantly, understanding CIDS will allow us to work on developing effective therapeutic strategies, with which the outcome after CNS damage by a host of diseases could be improved by eliminating a major determinant of poor recovery.},

abstract = {Novel and diverse functions of glial cells are currently the focus of much attention A. Volterra and J. Meldolesi (2005) Nature Rev. 6, 626-640. Here we present evidence that rat astroglia release acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as part of their response to hypoxic damage. Exposure of astroglia to tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and hence oxidative stress, subsequently leads to a switching in mRNA from the classical membrane-bound T-AChE to a preferential increase in the splice variant for a soluble form, R-AChE, This change in expression is reflected in increased perinuclear and reduced cytoplasmic AChE staining of the insulted glial cells, with a concomitant and marked increase in extracellular secretion that peaks at 1 h post-treatment. An analogous increase in R-AChE, over a similar time scale, occurs in response to psychological stress D. Kaufer et al. (1998) Nature 93, 373-377, as well as to head injury and stroke E. Shohami et al. (1999) J. Neurotrauma 6, 365-76. The data presented here suggest that glial cells may be key chemical intermediaries in such situations and, perhaps more generally in pathological conditions involving oxidative stress, such as neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Neuroblastoma cell lines LA-N-1 and LA-N-2 were established from neuroblastoma cells in the bone marrow and in the primary tumor, respectively, of two children with metastatic neuroblastoma. Morphology, growth in vitro and in athymic nude mice, chromosomal pattern, and fibrinolytic activity of these cell lines and of previously established human neuroblastoma cell lines IMR-32, SK-N-MC, and SK-N-SH were compared. Most LA-N-1 cells were tear-drop shaped, small cells with processes; they tended to grow in clusters. LA-N-2 was comprised of elongated cells and small round cells, the latter growing in dense clumps on the former. Electron microscopy revealed numerous cytoplasmic dense cores in many LA-N-1 cells but none in LA-N-2 cells. During logarithmic growth in vitro, doubling times for LA-N-1, LA-N-2, SK-N-MC, SK-N-SH, and IMR-32 cells were 32, 56, 23, 36, and 26 hr, respectively. Cells of all lines formed colonies in soft agar, and, after variable latency periods, LA-N-1, LA-N-2, SK-N-MC, and IMR-32 cells formed tumors in athymic nude mice. The marker chromosome(s) characteristic of each cell line was present in more than 90{\%} of cells of a given line. Significant plasminogen-dependent fibrinolytic activity was present in cells of all lines. These studies indicate that LA-N-1 and LA-N-2 cells arose from single but different aberrant progenitor cells and that they have properties of neuroblastoma cells. They also demonstrate that cell lines derived from human neuroblastomas are heterogenous as are the tumors in children. {\textcopyright} 1977, American Association for Cancer Research.

abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key neurotrophic factor in the brain. It plays an important role in the etiopathogenesis and pharmacotherapy of mental disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia. In recent years, studies have shown that cognitive processes, which are impaired in the course of mental disorders, significantly change BDNF levels in the brain. Administered to rats at a dose of 20 mg/kg (b.d. for 5 weeks), venlafaxine (VEN) increases BDNF levels in the hippocampus and cortex, compared to controls. Administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (b.d. for 5 weeks), olanzapine (OLA) significantly increases BDNF levels in both the cortex and the hippocampus. Similarly, nicotine (NIC) administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg (b.d. for 5 weeks) increases BDNF concentrations in both the hippocampus and the cortex. Combined administration of NIC with VEN or OLAdoes not increase BDNF levels in the hippocampus or the cortex. Based on our study, it can be claimed thatBDNFmediates behavioral responses only to drugs used individually and participates in the antidepressant and procognitive effects of the study compounds. BDNF also initiates plastic changes and modulation of synaptic activity in rat brains. Copyrigth {\textcopyright} 2009 by Institute of Pharmacology Polish Academy of Sciences.},

abstract = {Although the role of APP and PSEN genes in genetic Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases is well established, fairly little is known about the molecular mechanisms affecting Abeta generation in sporadic AD. Deficiency in Abeta clearance is certainly a possibility, but increased expression of proteins like APP or BACE1/beta-secretase may also be associated with the disease. We therefore investigated changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of sporadic AD patients and found that several miRNAs potentially involved in the regulation of APP and BACE1 expression appeared to be decreased in diseased brain. We show here that miR-29a, -29b-1, and -9 can regulate BACE1 expression in vitro. The miR-29a/b-1 cluster was significantly (and AD-dementia-specific) decreased in AD patients displaying abnormally high BACE1 protein. Similar correlations between expression of this cluster and BACE1 were found during brain development and in primary neuronal cultures. Finally, we provide evidence for a potential causal relationship between miR-29a/b-1 expression and Abeta generation in a cell culture model. We propose that loss of specific miRNAs can contribute to increased BACE1 and Abeta levels in sporadic AD.},

BALB/C, C57Bl/6, C3H/He and CD-1 mouse strains were tested in the elevated plus maze in two sessions, separated by 48h. All strains, except CD-1, showed the expected reduction in open arm exploration on the second session. BALB/C and C3H mice spent a greater proportion of the time in the open arms on the first exposure, but spent more time immobile in the maze compared to the CD1 and C57 strains. Immobility was attenuated upon the second exposure in all strains, except the BALB/C mice. Real-time PCR was used to investigate regional and strain differences in induction of AChE-R mRNA following four daily injections of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) (.1mg/kg). AChE-R induction was found in the frontal cortex, but not in amygdala, hippocampus or striatum of CD-1 mice. Nor was there AChE-R induction in the brains of the inbred strains. Four daily sessions of swim stress were used to investigate stress-induced induction of AChE-R. BALB/C mice showed significantly more immobility in the forced swim test (FST) compared to the other strains. FST did not induce AChE-R mRNA in any brain region tested; however, AChE-R mRNA expression in the frontal cortex was negatively correlated with immobility in the FST.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019, The Author(s). We endeavored to identify objective blood biomarkers for pain, a subjective sensation with a biological basis, using a stepwise discovery, prioritization, validation, and testing in independent cohorts design. We studied psychiatric patients, a high risk group for co-morbid pain disorders and increased perception of pain. For discovery, we used a powerful within-subject longitudinal design. We were successful in identifying blood gene expression biomarkers that were predictive of pain state, and of future emergency department (ED) visits for pain, more so when personalized by gender and diagnosis. MFAP3, which had no prior evidence in the literature for involvement in pain, had the most robust empirical evidence from our discovery and validation steps, and was a strong predictor for pain in the independent cohorts, particularly in females and males with PTSD. Other biomarkers with best overall convergent functional evidence for involvement in pain were GNG7, CNTN1, LY9, CCDC144B, and GBP1. Some of the individual biomarkers identified are targets of existing drugs. Moreover, the biomarker gene expression signatures were used for bioinformatic drug repurposing analyses, yielding leads for possible new drug candidates such as SC-560 (an NSAID), and amoxapine (an antidepressant), as well as natural compounds such as pyridoxine (vitamin B6), cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), and apigenin (a plant flavonoid).

abstract = {Circulating cell-free microRNAs (miRNAs) are stable in many biological fluids and their expression profiles can suffer changes under different physiological and pathological conditions. In the last few years, miRNAs have been proposed as putative noninvasive biomarkers in diagnosis, prognosis and response to treatment for several diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive and/or motor impairments are usually considered for establishing clinical diagnosis, and at this stage, the majority of the neurons may already be lost making difficult attempts of novel therapies. In this review, we intend to survey the circulating cell-free miRNAs found as dysregulated in cerebrospinal fluid, serum and plasma samples in AD and PD patients, and show how those miRNAs can be useful for early and differential diagnosis. Beyond that, we highlighted the miRNAs that are possibly related to common molecular mechanisms in the neurodegeneration process, as ...},

abstract = {Cholinergic neurotransmission throughout the neocortex and hippocampus regulates arousal, learning, and attention. However, owing to the poorly characterized timing and location of acetylcholine release, its detailed behavioral functions remain unclear. Using electrochemical biosensors chronically implanted in mice, we made continuous measurements of the spatiotemporal dynamics of acetylcholine release across multiple behavioral states. We found that tonic levels of acetylcholine release were coordinated between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and maximal during training on a rewarded working memory task. Tonic release also increased during REM sleep but was contingent on subsequent wakefulness. In contrast, coordinated phasic acetylcholine release occurred only during the memory task and was strongly localized to reward delivery areas without being contingent on trial outcome. These results show that coordinated acetylcholine release between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is associated with reward and arousal on distinct timescales, providing dual mechanisms to support learned behavior acquisition during cognitive task performance.},

As a result, it changes the state of neuronal networks throughout the brain and modifies their response to internal and external inputs: the classical role of a neuromodulator. Here, we identify actions of cholinergic signaling on cellular and synaptic properties of neurons in several brain areas and discuss consequences of this signaling on behaviors related to drug abuse, attention, food intake, and affect. The diverse effects of acetylcholine depend on site of release, receptor subtypes, and target neuronal population; however, a common theme is that acetylcholine potentiates behaviors that are adaptive to environmental stimuli and decreases responses to ongoing stimuli that do not require immediate action. The ability of acetylcholine to coordinate the response of neuronal networks in many brain areas makes cholinergic modulation an essential mechanism underlying complex behaviors.},

abstract = {Non-coding RNAs generally form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with their partner proteins to exert their functions. Small RNAs, including microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, and PIWI-interacting RNAs, assemble with Argonaute (Ago) family proteins into the effector complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates sequence-specific target gene silencing. RISC assembly is not a simple binding between a small RNA and Ago; rather, it follows an ordered multi-step pathway that requires specific accessory factors. Some steps of RISC assembly and RISC-mediated gene silencing are dependent on or facilitated by particular intracellular platforms, suggesting their spatial regulation. In this review, we summarize the currently known mechanisms for RISC assembly of each small RNA class and propose a revised model for the role of the chaperone machinery in the duplex-initiated RISC assembly pathway.

abstract = {Stroke-associated pneumonia is a frequent complication after stroke associated with poor outcome. Dysphagia is a known risk factor for stroke-associated pneumonia but accumulating evidence suggests that stroke induces an immunodepressive state increasing susceptibility for stroke-associated pneumonia. We aimed to confirm that stroke-induced immunodepression syndrome is associated with stroke-associated pneumonia independently from dysphagia by investigating the predictive properties of monocytic HLA-DR expression as a marker of immunodepression as well as biomarkers for inflammation (interleukin-6) and infection (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein). This was a prospective, multicenter study with 11 study sites in Germany and Spain, including 486 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Daily screening for stroke-associated pneumonia, dysphagia and biomarkers was performed. Frequency of stroke-associated pneumonia was 5.2{\%}. Dysphagia and decreased monocytic HLA-DR were independent predictors for stroke-associated pneumonia in multivariable regression analysis. Proportion of pneumonia ranged between 0.9{\%} in the higher monocytic HLA-DR quartile ({\textgreater}/=21,876 mAb/cell) and 8.5{\%} in the lower quartile ({\textless}/=12,369 mAb/cell). In the presence of dysphagia, proportion of pneumonia increased to 5.9{\%} and 18.8{\%}, respectively. Patients without dysphagia and normal monocytic HLA-DR expression had no stroke-associated pneumonia risk. We demonstrate that dysphagia and stroke-induced immunodepression syndrome are independent risk factors for stroke-associated pneumonia. Screening for immunodepression and dysphagia might be useful for identifying patients at high risk for stroke-associated pneumonia.},

abstract = {Cognitive decline is a common problem of aging. Whereas multiple neural and glial mechanisms may account for these declines, microglial sensitization and/or dystrophy has emerged as a leading culprit in brain aging and dysfunction. However, glial activation is consistently observed in normal brain aging as well, independent of frank neuroinflammation or functional impairment. Such variability suggests the existence of additional vulnerability factors that can impact neuronal-glial interactions and thus overall brain and cognitive health. The goal of this review is to elucidate our working hypothesis that an individual's risk or resilience to neuroinflammatory disorders and poor cognitive aging may critically depend on their early life experience, which can change immune reactivity within the brain for the remainder of the lifespan. For instance, early-life infection in rats can profoundly disrupt memory function in young adulthood, as well as accelerate age-related cognitive decline, both of which are linked to enduring changes in glial function that occur in response to the initial infection. We discuss these findings within the context of the growing literature on the role of immune molecules and neuroimmune crosstalk in normal brain development. We highlight the intrinsic factors (e.g., chemokines, hormones) that regulate microglial development and their colonization of the embryonic and postnatal brain, and the capacity for disruption or "re-programming" of this crucial process by external events (e.g., stress, infection). An impact on glia, which in turn alters neural development, has the capacity to profoundly impact cognitive and mental health function at all stages of life.},

abstract = { Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are complex psychiatric diseases with risks contributed by multiple genes. Dysregulation of gene expression has been implicated in these disorders, but little is known about such dysregulation in the human brain. We analyzed three transcriptome datasets from 394 postmortem brain tissue samples from patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder or from healthy control individuals without a known history of psychiatric disease. We built genome-wide coexpression networks that included microRNAs (miRNAs). We identified a coexpression network module that was differentially expressed in the brain tissue from patients compared to healthy control individuals. This module contained genes that were principally involved in glial and neural cell genesis and glial cell differentiation, and included schizophrenia risk genes carrying rare variants. This module included five miRNAs and 545 mRNAs, with six transcription factors serving as hub genes in this module. We found that the most connected transcription factor gene POU3F2 , also identified on a genome-wide association study for bipolar disorder, could regulate the miRNA hsa-miR-320e and other putative target mRNAs. These regulatory relationships were replicated using PsychENCODE/BrainGVEX datasets and validated by knockdown and overexpression experiments in SH-SY5Y cells and human neural progenitor cells in vitro. Thus, we identified a brain gene expression module that was enriched for rare coding variants in genes associated with schizophrenia and that contained the putative bipolar disorder risk gene POU3F2 . The transcription factor POU3F2 may be a key regulator of gene expression in this disease-associated gene coexpression module. },

abstract = {This study demonstrates the presence of positive and negative regulatory elements within a 2336-base pair- long region of the rat choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) gene promoter that cooperate to direct cell type-specific expression in cholinergic cells. A 21-base pair-long neu- ron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) was identified in the proximal part of this region. This element was recognized by the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), previously shown to regulate expression of other neuron-specific genes. The ChAT NRSE was inac- tive in both cholinergic and non-cholinergic neuronal cells, but repressed expression from a heterologous pro- moter in non-neuronal cells. Specific deletion of this element allowed ChAT gene promoter activity in non- neuronal cells, and overexpression of NRSF repressed ChAT gene promoter activity in cholinergic cells. The distal part of the ChAT gene promoter showed cholin- ergic-specific enhancing activity, which stimulated pro- moter activity in cholinergic cells, but was inactive in non-cholinergic neuronal and non-neuronal cells. This enhancer region suppressed the activity of the ChAT NRSE in cholinergic cells, even after NRSF overexpres- sion. Thus, at least two kinds of regulatory elements cooperate to direct ChAT gene expression to cholinergic neurons, namely a neuron-restrictive silencer element and a cholinergic-specific enhancer.},

abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease, accumulation of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) is associated with loss of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synapses, and memory. Previous work demonstrated that A$\beta$ decreases activity-induced BDNF transcription by regulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. However, the specific mechanism by which A$\beta$ reduces basal BDNF expression remains unclear. Differentiated, unstimulated human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells treated with oligomeric A$\beta$ exhibited significantly reduced CREB messenger RNA compared with controls. Phosphorylated and total CREB proteins were decreased in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of A$\beta$-treated cells. However, neither pCREB129 nor pCREB133 levels were altered relative to total CREB levels. The protein kinase A activator forskolin increased pCREB133 levels and prevented A$\beta$-induced basal BDNF loss when administered before A$\beta$ but did not rescue BDNF expression when administered later. These data demonstrate a new mechanism for A$\beta$-induced BDNF downregulation: in the absence of cell stimulation, A$\beta$ downregulates basal BDNF levels via A$\beta$-induced CREB transcriptional downregulation, not changes in CREB phosphorylation. Thus, A$\beta$ reduces basal and activity-induced BDNF expression by different mechanisms.},

abstract = {Maintenance of the drug-addicted state is thought to involve changes in gene expression in different neuronal cell types and neural circuits. Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons in particular mediate numerous responses to drugs of abuse. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate CNS gene expression through a variety of mechanisms, but next to nothing is known about their role in drug abuse. The proportion of lncRNAs that are primate-specific provides a strong rationale for their study in human drug abusers. In this study, we determined a profile of dysregulated putative lncRNAs through the analysis of postmortem human midbrain specimens from chronic cocaine abusers and well-matched control subjects (n = 11 in each group) using a custom lncRNA microarray. A dataset comprising 32 well-annotated lncRNAs with independent evidence of brain expression and robust differential expression in cocaine abusers is presented. For a subset of these lncRNAs, differential expression was validated by quantitative real-time PCR and cellular localization determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Examples of lncRNAs exhibiting DA cell-specific expression, different subcellular distributions, and covariance of expression with known cocaine-regulated protein-coding genes were identified. These findings implicate lncRNAs in the cellular responses of human DA neurons to chronic cocaine abuse. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate the expression of protein-coding genes, but little is known about their potential role in drug abuse. In this study, we identified lncRNAs differentially expressed in human cocaine abusers' midbrains. One up-regulated antisense lncRNA, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3-interacting protein 2-antisense 1 (TRAF3IP2-AS1), was found predominantly in the nucleus of human dopamine (DA) neurons, whereas the related TRAF3IP2 protein-coding transcript was distributed throughout these cells. The abundances of these transcripts were significantly correlated (left) suggesting that TRAF3IP2-AS1 may regulate TRAF3IP2 gene expression, perhaps through local chromatin changes at this locus (right).},

abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs that control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. These small regulatory molecules play a key role in the majority of biological processes and their expression is also tightly regulated. Both the deregulation of genes controlled by miRNAs and the altered miRNA expression have been linked to many disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, it is of particular interest to reliably predict potential miRNA targets which might be involved in these diseases. However, interactions between miRNAs and their targets are complex and very often there are numerous putative miRNA recognition sites in mRNAs. Many miRNA targets have been computationally predicted but only a limited number of these were experimentally validated. Although a variety of miRNA target prediction algorithms are available, results of their application are often inconsistent. Hence, finding a functional miRNA target is still a challenging task. In this review, currently available and frequently used computational tools for miRNA target prediction, i.e., PicTar, TargetScan, DIANA-microT, miRanda, rna22 and PITA are outlined and various practical aspects of miRNA target analysis are extensively discussed. Moreover, the performance of three algorithms (PicTar, TargetScan and DIANA-microT) is both demonstrated and evaluated by performing an in-depth analysis of miRNA interactions with mRNAs derived from genes triggering hereditary neurological disorders known as trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases (TREDs), such as Huntington's disease (HD), a number of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).},

abstract = {The relationship between long-term cholinergic dysfunction and risk of developing dementia is poorly understood. Here we used mice with deletion of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in the forebrain to model cholinergic abnormalities observed in dementia. Whole-genome RNA sequencing of hippocampal samples revealed that cholinergic failure causes changes in RNA metabolism. Remarkably, key transcripts related to Alzheimer's disease are affected. BACE1, for instance, shows abnormal splicing caused by decreased expression of the splicing regulator hnRNPA2/B1. Resulting BACE1 overexpression leads to increased APP processing and accumulation of soluble A$\beta$1-42 This is accompanied by age-related increases in GSK3 activation, tau hyperphosphorylation, caspase-3 activation, decreased synaptic markers, increased neuronal death, and deteriorating cognition. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 hyperactivation reversed deficits in synaptic markers and tau hyperphosphorylation induced by cholinergic dysfunction, indicating a key role for GSK3 in some of these pathological changes. Interestingly, in human brains there was a high correlation between decreased levels of VAChT and hnRNPA2/B1 levels with increased tau hyperphosphorylation. These results suggest that changes in RNA processing caused by cholinergic loss can facilitate Alzheimer's-like pathology in mice, providing a mechanism by which decreased cholinergic tone may increase risk of dementia.},

abstract = {The majority of cortical interneurons use GABA (gamma amino butyric acid) as inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABAergic neurons are morphologically, connectionally, electrically and chemically heterogeneous. In rat cerebral cortex three distinct groups of GABAergic interneurons have been identified by the expression of parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR) and somatostatin (SOM). Recent studies in mouse cerebral cortex have revealed a different organization in which the CR and SOM populations are partially overlapping. Because CR and SOM neurons derive from different progenitors located in different embryonic structures, the coexpression of CR + SOM suggests that the chemical differentiation of interneurons is regulated postmitotically. Here, we have taken an important first step towards understanding this process by triple immunostaining mouse visual cortex with a panel of antibodies, which has been used extensively for classifying developing interneurons. We have found at least 13 distinct groups of GABAergic neurons which include PV, CR, SOM, CCK (cholecystokinin), CR + SOM, CR + NPY (neuropeptide Y), CR + VIP (vasointestinal polypeptide), SOM + NPY, SOM + VIP, VIP + ChAT (choline acetyltransferase), CCK + NPY, CR + SOM + NPY and CR + SOM + VIP expressing cells. Triple immunostaining with PV, CR and SOM antibodies during postnatal development further showed that PV is never colocalized with CR and SOM. Importantly, expression of SOM and CR + SOM developed after the percentage of CR cells that do not express SOM has reached the mature level, suggesting that the chemical differentiation of SOM and CR + SOM neurons is a postnatal event, which may be controlled by transcriptional regulation.},

It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings.

Both AChE and BuChE have been shown to copurify with peptidases. 3. BuChE has also been shown to copurify with other proteins such as transferrin, with which it forms a stable complex. In addition, BuChE is found in association with beta-amyloid protein in Alzheimer brain tissues. 4. Since BuChE copurifies with peptidases, we hypothesized that BuChE interacts with these enzymes and that this association had an influence on their catalytic activities. One of the peptidases that copurifies with cholinesterases has specificity similar to trypsin, hence, this enzyme was used as a model to test this hypothesis. 5. Purified BuChE causes a concentration-dependent enhancement of the catalytic activity of trypsin while trypsin does not influence the catalytic activity of BuChE. 6. We suggest that, in addition to its esterase activity, BuChE may assume a regulatory role by interacting with other proteins.},

abstract = {T and B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) all express most of the components necessary for a functional cholinergic system. This includes choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (mAChRs and nAChRs, respectively) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Immunological activation of T cells up-regulates cholinergic activity, including ChAT and AChE expression. Moreover, toll-like receptor agonists induce ChAT expression in DCs and macrophages, suggesting cholinergic involvement in the regulation of immune function. Immune cells express all five M1–M5 mAChR subtypes and several nAChR subtypes, including $\alpha$7. Modulation of antigen-specific antibody and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in M1/M5 mAChR gene-knockout (KO) and $\alpha$7 nAChR-KO mice further support the idea of a non-neuronal cholinergic system contributing to the regulation of immune function. Evidence also suggests that $\alpha$7 nAChRs are involved in suppressing DC and macrophage activity, leading to suppression of T cell differentiation into effector T cells. These findings suggest the possibility that immune function could be modulated by manipulating immune cell cholinergic activity using specific agonists and antagonists. Therefore, a fuller understanding of the immune cell cholinergic system should be useful for the development of drugs and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases and cancers.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Accumulating evidence in AD research suggests that alterations in the microRNA (miRNA) network could contribute to risk for the disease. miRNAs are conserved small non-coding RNAs that control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level and are essential for neuronal function and survival. The results from recent profiling experiments in humans suggest that a number of specific miRNAs are misregulated in disease conditions, several of which have been implicated in the regulation of key genes involved in AD, including APP, BACE1 and MAPT. Moreover, rare disease-specific polymorphisms have been identified in known and putative miRNA target sites located within the 3'untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of APP and BACE1 genes. Here, we review current findings regarding miRNA research in humans and various cellular and animal models to provide a strong basis for future research aimed at understanding the potential contribution of miRNAs to AD pathophysiology.},

abstract = {Mental stress modifies both cholinergic neurotransmission and alternative splicing in the brain, via incompletely understood mechanisms. Here, we report that stress changes brain microRNA (miR) expression and that some of these stress-regulated miRs regulate alternative splicing. Acute and chronic immobilization stress differentially altered the expression of numerous miRs in two stress-responsive regions of the rat brain, the hippocampal CA1 region and the central nucleus of the amygdala. miR-134 and miR-183 levels both increased in the amygdala following acute stress, compared to unstressed controls. Chronic stress decreased miR-134 levels, whereas miR-183 remained unchanged in both the amygdala and CA1. Importantly, miR-134 and miR-183 share a common predicted mRNA target, encoding the splicing factor SC35. Stress was previously shown to upregulate SC35, which promotes the alternative splicing of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from the synapse-associated isoform AChE-S to the, normally rare, soluble AChE-R protein. Knockdown of miR-183 expression increased SC35 protein levels in vitro, whereas overexpression of miR-183 reduced SC35 protein levels, suggesting a physiological role for miR-183 regulation under stress. We show stress-induced changes in miR-183 and miR-134 and suggest that, by regulating splicing factors and their targets, these changes modify both alternative splicing and cholinergic neurotransmission in the stressed brain.},

For example, increased understanding of mechanisms underlying cholinergic modulation of cortical function has provided insight into attentional dysfunction in schizophrenia. Acetylcholine normally enhances cortical sensitivity to external stimuli and decreases corticocortical communication, increasing focused attention; however, increases in ACh signaling can lead to symptoms related to anxiety and depression. For example, while stress-induced ACh release can result in adaptive responses to environmental stimuli, chronic elevations in cholinergic signaling may produce maladaptive behaviors. Here, we review several innovations in human imaging, molecular genetics and physiological control of circuits that have begun to identify mechanisms linking altered cholinergic neuromodulation to schizophrenia and depression. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

We argue that these effects indicate that acetylcholine is necessary for some, but not all, hippocampal-dependent processes. We review recent evidence from lesion, pharmacological and electrophysiological studies to support the view that a primary function of septohippocampal acetylcholine is to reduce interference in the learning process by adaptively timing and separating encoding and retrieval processes. We reinterpret cholinergic-lesion based deficits according to this view and propose that acetylcholine reduces the interference elicited by the movement of salient locations between events. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The importance of these neurons in the etiology of neurocognitive disorders has been well documented, but our understanding of their specification during embryogenesis is still incomplete. All forebrain cholinergic projection neurons and interneurons appear to share a common developmental origin in the embryonic ventral telencephalon, a region that also gives rise to GABAergic projection neurons and interneurons. Significant progress has been made in identifying the key intrinsic and extrinsic factors that promote a cholinergic fate in this precursor population. However, how cholinergic interneurons and projection neurons differentiate from one another during development, as well as how distinct developmental programs contribute to heterogeneity within those two classes, is not yet well understood. In this review we summarize the transcription factors and signaling molecules known to play a role in the specification and early development of striatal and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. We also discuss the heterogeneity of these populations and its possible developmental origins.},

abstract = {This paper considers psychotic symptoms in terms of false inferences or beliefs. It is based on the notion that the brain is an inference machine that actively constructs hypotheses to explain or predict its sensations. This perspective provides a normative (Bayes-optimal) account of action and perception that emphasizes probabilistic representations; in particular, the confidence or precision of beliefs about the world. We will consider hallucinosis, abnormal eye movements, sensory attenuation deficits, catatonia, and delusions as various expressions of the same core pathology: namely, an aberrant encoding of precision. From a cognitive perspective, this represents a pernicious failure of metacognition (beliefs about beliefs) that can confound perceptual inference. In the embodied setting of active (Bayesian) inference, it can lead to behaviors that are paradoxically more accurate than Bayes-optimal behavior. Crucially, this normative account is accompanied by a neuronally plausible process theory based upon hierarchical predictive coding. In predictive coding, precision is thought to be encoded by the post-synaptic gain of neurons reporting prediction error. This suggests that both pervasive trait abnormalities and florid failures of inference in the psychotic state can be linked to factors controlling post-synaptic gain - such as NMDA receptor function and (dopaminergic) neuromodulation. We illustrate these points using biologically plausible simulations of perceptual synthesis, smooth pursuit eye movements and attribution of agency - that all use the same predictive coding scheme and pathology: namely, a reduction in the precision of prior beliefs, relative to sensory evidence.},

The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein has been implicated in these responses, although its role has not been defined. Here, we show that PML isoform II (PML-II) is specifically required for efficient induction of IFN-$\beta$ transcription and of numerous ISGs, acting at the point of transcriptional complex assembly on target gene promoters. PML-II associated with specific transcription factors NF-$\kappa$B and STAT1, as well as the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP), to facilitate transcriptional complex formation. The absence of PML-II substantially reduced binding of these factors and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to IFN-$\beta$ or ISGs promoters and sharply reduced gene activation. The unique C-terminal domain of PML-II was essential for its activity, while the N-terminal RBCC motif common to all PML isoforms was dispensable. We propose a model in which PML-II contributes to the transcription of multiple genes via the association of its C-terminal domain with relevant transcription complexes, which promotes the stable assembly of these complexes at promoters/enhancers of target genes, and that in this way PML-II plays a significant role in the development of type I IFN responses.},

Examining 20 730 individuals, we report a molecular genetics-based heritability estimate (h(2)SNP) for European-American females of 29{\%} that is similar to h(2)SNP for schizophrenia and is substantially higher than h(2)SNP in European-American males (estimate not distinguishable from zero). We found strong evidence of overlapping genetic risk between PTSD and schizophrenia along with more modest evidence of overlap with bipolar and major depressive disorder. No single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exceeded genome-wide significance in the transethnic (overall) meta-analysis and we do not replicate previously reported associations. Still, SNP-level summary statistics made available here afford the best-available molecular genetic index of PTSD-for both European- and African-American individuals-and can be used in polygenic risk prediction and genetic correlation studies of diverse phenotypes. Publication of summary statistics for ∼10 000 African Americans contributes to the broader goal of increased ancestral diversity in genomic data resources. In sum, the results demonstrate genetic influences on the development of PTSD, identify shared genetic risk between PTSD and other psychiatric disorders and highlight the importance of multiethnic/racial samples. As has been the case with schizophrenia and other complex genetic disorders, larger sample sizes are needed to identify specific risk loci.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 25 April 2017; doi:10.1038/mp.2017.77.},

We grouped the samples according to tissue types, and in each of the groups, we identified genes that are stably expressed across biological samples, treatment conditions, and experiments. We fit a Poisson log-linear mixed-effect model to the read counts for each gene and decomposed the total variance into between-sample, between-treatment and between-experiment variance components. Identifying stably expressed genes is useful for count normalization and differential expression analysis. The variance component analysis that we explore here is a first step towards understanding the sources and nature of the RNA-Seq count variation. When using a numerical measure to identify stably expressed genes, the outcome depends on multiple factors: the background sample set and the reference gene set used for count normalization, the technology used for measuring gene expression, and the specific numerical stability measure used. Since differential expression (DE) is measured by relative frequencies, we argue that DE is a relative concept. We advocate using an explicit reference gene set for count normalization to improve interpretability of DE results, and recommend using a common reference gene set when analyzing multiple RNA-Seq experiments to avoid potential inconsistent conclusions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The emerging complexity of the transcriptional landscape poses great challenges to our conventional preconceptions of how the genome regulates brain function and dysfunction. Non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) confer a high level of intricate and dynamic regulation of various molecular processes in the CNS and they have been implicated in neurodevelopment and brain ageing, as well as in synapse function and cognitive performance, in both health and disease. ncRNA-mediated processes may be involved in various aspects of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding these events may help to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Here, we provide an overview of the complex mechanisms that are affected by the diverse ncRNA classes that have been implicated in neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Most individuals with schizophrenia suffer some cognitive dysfunction: such deficits are predictive of longer-term functioning; and current dopamine-blocking antipsychotics have made little impact on this domain. There is a pressing need to develop novel pharmacological agents to tackle this insidious but most disabling of problems. The acetylcholinergic system is involved in cognitive and attentional processing, and its metabotropic and nicotinic receptors are widespread throughout the brain. Deficits in acetylcholinergic functioning occur in schizophrenia, and high rates of tobacco smoking have been posited to represent a form of self-medication. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has emerged as a putative target to improve cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, and this study systematically reviewed the emerging data. Nineteen studies were identified, covering three compound classes: agonists at the $\alpha$7 and $\alpha$ 4$\beta$2 nAChRs, and positive allosteric modulators.

abstract = {Summary Sleep, waking, locomotion, and attention are associated with cell-type-specific changes in neocortical activity. The effect of brain state on circuit output requires understanding of how neuromodulators influence specific neuronal classes and their synapses, with normal patterns of neuromodulator release from endogenous sources. We investigated the state-dependent modulation of a ubiquitous feedforward inhibitory motif in mouse sensory cortex, local pyramidal (Pyr) inputs onto somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons. Paired whole-cell recordings in acute brain slices and in vivo showed that Pyr-to-SST synapses are remarkably weak, with failure rates approaching 80{\%}. Pharmacological screening revealed that cholinergic agonists uniquely enhance synaptic efficacy. Brief, optogenetically gated acetylcholine release dramatically enhanced Pyr-to-SST input, via nicotinic receptors and presynaptic PKA signaling. Importantly, endogenous acetylcholine release preferentially activated nicotinic, not muscarinic, receptors, thus differentiating drug effects from endogenous neurotransmission. Brain state- and synapse-specific unmasking of synapses may be a powerful way to functionally rewire cortical circuits dependent on behavioral demands.},

abstract = {Mercurials are global environmental pollutants deriving from natural processes and anthropogenic activities. Most human exposure to mercury occurs through the intake of fish, shellfish, and sea mammals contaminated with methylmercury. Methylmercury is bioaccumulated and biomagnified in the aquatic food chain and reaches its highest levels in top predatory fish. The neurotoxic hazard posed by methylmercury to humans and the unique susceptibility of the developing brain have been well documented following the mass poisonings occurring in Japan and Iraq. Adult cases of methylmercury poisoning are characterized by the delayed onset of symptoms and by the focal degeneration of neurons in selected brain regions (for example, cerebral cortex and cerebellum). Why the fetus displays different neuropathological effects and a higher sensitivity to methylmercury relative to the adult is still unknown. Depending on the degree of in utero exposure, methylmercury may result in effects ranging from fetal death to subtle neurodevelopmental delays. On the basis of epidemiological studies performed in populations having moderate chronic methylmercury exposure, no definitive consensus has been reached to date on the safety level of maternal exposure during pregnancy. Among the multiple mechanisms believed to contribute to methylmercury neurotoxicity, methylmercury-induced microtubule alterations, oxidative damage, impairment of calcium homeostasis, and the potentiation of glutamatergic neurotransmission are presented in this review.},

abstract = {Glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity is mediated by glutathione depletion in the HT22 mouse hippocampal cell line. Previous results with pharmacological agents implicated the extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1/2 (ERK1/2) in glutamate toxicity in HT22 cells and immature embryonic rat cortical neurons. In this report, we definitively establish a role for ERK1/2 in oxidative toxicity using dominant negative MEK1 expression in transiently transfected HT22 cells to block glutamate-induced cell death. In contrast, chronic activation of ERK (i.e. brought about by transfection of constitutively active ERK2 chimera) is not sufficient to trigger HT22 cell death demonstrating that ERK1/2 activation is not sufficient for toxicity. Activation of ERK1/2 in HT22 cells has a distinct kinetic profile with an initial peak occurring between 30 min and 1 h of glutamate treatment and a second peak typically emerging after 6 h. We demonstrate here that the initial phase of ERK1/2 induction is because of activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor type I (mGluRI). ERK1/2 activation by mGluRI contributes to an HT22 cell adaptive response to oxidative stress as glutamate-induced toxicity is enhanced upon pharmacological inhibition of mGluRI. The protective effect of ERK1/2 activation at early times after glutamate treatment is mediated by a restoration of glutathione (GSH) levels that are reduced because of depletion of intracellular cysteine pools. Thus, ERK1/2 appears to play dual roles in HT22 cells acting as part of a cellular adaptive response during the initial phases of glutamate-induced oxidative stress and contributing to toxicity during later stages of stress.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The role of neuronal Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in nerve injury is being pursued actively. However, the endogenous activation of neuronal TLR4 during neuroinflammation, in absence of the participation of glial TLR4, remains elusive. Here, we identified lysozyme as an endogenous activator of neuronal TLR4 signaling during nerve injury. Upon nerve injury, enhanced expression of lysozyme promoted neuronal hyperexcitability and neuropathic pain. Injections of lysozyme in healthy rats increased their mechanical and thermal pain sensitivity. Likewise, infusion of spinal cord slices with lysozyme increased neuronal excitability typical of neuropathic pain. Our results also showed that lysozyme activated excitability of both A$\delta$- and C-fibers. Thus, in addition to the discovery of lysozyme as an endogenous ligand for regulating neuronal TLR4 signaling, this study also lays the foundation of our understanding of its role in nervous system pathologies, providing multiple avenues for treating neuroinflammation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Much research in comparative biochemistry is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that allow organisms to adapt to and survive diverse environmental challenges. In recent years, genomic and proteomic approaches have been key drivers of advancement in the field, for example, providing knowledge about gene and protein expression, regulation of signal transduction pathways, and functional control of enzymes/proteins by reversible protein phosphorylation. Advances in comparative biochemistry have always drawn upon conceptual and technological advances that arise from "mainline" biochemistry and molecular biology, often from medical models. The present article discusses three such advances that will have major impacts on comparative biochemistry in the 21st century. The first is the crucial role of posttranslational modification in metabolic control, expanding outwards from reversible phosphorylation to explore the individual and interacting effects of protein modification by acetylation, methylation, SUMOylation and O-GlcNAcylation, among others. The second is the newly recognized role of non-coding RNA in the regulation of gene expression, particularly the action of microRNAs. The third is the emergence of powerful multiplex technology that allows rapid, high-throughput detection of analytes and will revolutionize RNA and protein profiling in the comparative biochemistry laboratory. Commercial tools such as Luminex allow researchers to simultaneously quantify up to 100 different analytes in a single sample, thereby creating broad functional analyses of metabolism and cell signaling pathways.},

They are particularly vulnerable to neuropathology in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may trigger the emergence of neuropathology in their cortico-amygdalar projection system through cholinergic denervation and trans-synaptic spreading of misfolded proteins. We examined whether longitudinal degeneration within the BF can explain longitudinal cortico-amygdalar degeneration in older human adults with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD neuropathology. We focused on two BF subregions, which are known to innervate cortico-amygdalar regions via two distinct macroscopic cholinergic projections. To further assess whether structural degeneration of these regions in AD reflects cholinergic denervation, we used the [ 18 F] FEOBV radiotracer, which binds to cortico-amygdalar cholinergic terminals. We found that the two BF subregions explain spatially distinct patterns of cortico-amygdalar degeneration, which closely reflect their cholinergic projections, and overlap with [ 18 F] FEOBV indices of cholinergic denervation.},

Numerous microRNAs have been found to play crucial roles in regulating A$\beta$ production in the process of AD. Previous investigations have reported lower levels of many microRNAs in AD patients and animal models. Here, we examined the role of miR-195 in the process of A$\beta$ formation. Bioinformatics' algorithms predicted miR-195 binding sites within the beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), and we found the level of miR-195 to be negatively related to the protein level of BACE1 in SAMP8 mice. We confirmed the target site in HEK293 cells by luciferase assay. Overexpression of miR-195 in N2a/WT cells decreased the BACE1 protein level, and inhibition of miR-195 resulted in increase of BACE1 protein level. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-195 in N2a/APP decreased the level of A$\beta$, while inhibition of miR-195 resulted in an increase of A$\beta$. Thus, we demonstrated that miR-195 could downregulate the level of A$\beta$ by inhibiting the translation of BACE1. We conclude that miR-195 might provide a therapeutic strategy for AD. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disorder with major risk factors including advanced age, presence of an apolipoprotein E $\epsilon$4 (APOE4) allele, and family history of AD. Other risk factors may be obesity and diabetes and related disorders, which are highly prevalent. METHODS We reviewed longitudinal epidemiological studies of body mass, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and glucose and insulin levels on risk for AD. We conducted meta-analyses of the results from these studies. RESULTS For obesity assessed by body mass index, the pooled effect size for AD was 1.59 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.02–2.5; z = 2.0; p = .042), and for diabetes, the pooled effect size for AD was 1.54 (95{\%} CI 1.33–1.79; z = 5.7; p {\textless} .001). Egger's test did not find significant evidence for publication bias in the meta-analysis for obesity (t = −1.4, p = .21) or for diabetes (t = −.86, p = .42). Since these disorders are highly comorbid, we conducted a meta-analysis combining all studies of obesity, diabetes, and abnormal glucose or insulin levels, which yielded a highly significant pooled effect size for AD of 1.63 (95{\%} CI 1.39–1.92; z = 5.9; p {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS Obesity and diabetes significantly and independently increase risk for AD. Though the level of risk is less than that with the APOE4 allele, the high prevalence of these disorders may result in substantial increases in future incidence of AD. Physiological changes common to obesity and diabetes plausibly promote AD.},

Akt phosphorylated at T308 inhibits TSC1/2 complex to activate mTORC1; mTORC2 is recognized as the kinase phosphorylating Akt at S473. Inhibition of autophagy by mTORC1 was shown to rescue disheveled (Dvl) leading to activation of Wnt pathway. Cyclin D1 and the c-Myc are activated by the Wnt signaling. Cyclin D1 is a key player in initiation of cell cycle. c-Myc triggers metabolic reprograming in G1 phase of cell cycle, which also activates the transcription factors like FoxO and p53 that play key roles in promoting the progression of cell cycle. While the role of p53 in cancer cell metabolism in arresting glycolysis and inhibition of pentose phosphate pathway has come to be recognized, there are confusions in the literature on the role of FoxO and that of rictor. FoxO was shown to be the transcription factor of rictor, in addition to the cell cycle inhibitors like p21. Rictor has dual roles; inhibition of c-Myc and constitution of mTORC2, both of which are key factors in the exit of G1-S phase and entry into G2 phase of cell cycle. A model is presented in this article, which suggests that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR and Wnt pathways converge and regulate the progression of cell cycle through G0-G1-S-phases and reprogram the metabolism in cancer cells. This model is different from the conventional method of looking at individual pathways triggering the cell cycle.},

abstract = {We have shown previously that the synergistic interaction of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and a coactivator (dopamine, protein kinase A, or protein kinase C activator) will induce the novel expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in neurons of the developing striatum. In this study we sought to determine whether, concomitant with TH expression, there were unique changes in transcription factors binding the AP-1 regulatory element on the TH gene. Indeed, we found a significant recruitment of proteins into TH-AP-1 complexes as well as a shift from low- to high-affinity binding. Supershift experiments further revealed dramatic changes in the proteins comprising the AP-1 complexes, including recruitment of the transcriptional activators c-Fos, a novel Fos protein, Fos-B, and Jun-D. Concomitantly, there was a decrease in repressor-type factors ATF-2 and CREM-1. aFGF appeared to play a central but insufficient role, requiring the further participation of at least one of the coactivating substances. Experiments examining the signal transduction pathway involved in mediating these nuclear events demonstrated that the presence of only an FGF (1, 2, 4, 9) competent to induce TH caused the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Moreover, the treatment of cells with MEK/ERK inhibitors (apigenin or PD98059) eliminated TH expression and the associated AP-1 changes, suggesting that MAPK was a critical mediator of these events. We conclude that, during transdifferentiation, signals may be transmitted via MAPK to the TH-AP-1 site to increase activators and reduce repressors, helping to shift the balance in favor of TH gene expression at this and possibly other important regulatory sites on the gene.},

Activation of the gp130 homodimer by IL-6 leads to the initiation of Jak/STAT signaling, a pathway that is often constitutively switched on in inflammatory malignancies. However, a plethora of studies in the last decade has convincingly shown that only signaling via the soluble IL-6R (trans-signaling) accounts for the deleterious effects of IL-6, whereas classic signaling via the membrane-bound receptor is essential for the regenerative and anti-bacterial effects of IL-6 (classic signaling). In this review, we highlight recent developments in the field of IL-6 research, and specifically focus on advances towards a safe and specific inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling.},

@article{McKim2016,
abstract = {UNLABELLED Repeated social defeat (RSD) is a murine stressor that recapitulates key physiological, immunological, and behavioral alterations observed in humans exposed to chronic psychosocial stress. Psychosocial stress promotes prolonged behavioral adaptations that are associated with neuroinflammatory signaling and impaired neuroplasticity. Here, we show that RSD promoted hippocampal neuroinflammatory activation that was characterized by proinflammatory gene expression and by microglia activation and monocyte trafficking that was particularly pronounced within the caudal extent of the hippocampus. Because the hippocampus is a key area involved in neuroplasticity, behavior, and cognition, we hypothesize that stress-induced neuroinflammation impairs hippocampal neurogenesis and promotes cognitive and affective behavioral deficits. We show here that RSD caused transient impairments in spatial memory recall that resolved within 28 d. In assessment of neurogenesis, the number of proliferating neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and the number of young, developing neurons were not affected initially after RSD. Nonetheless, the neuronal differentiation of NPCs that proliferated during RSD was significantly impaired when examined 10 and 28 d later. In addition, social avoidance, a measure of depressive-like behavior associated with caudal hippocampal circuitry, persisted 28 d after RSD. Treatment with minocycline during RSD prevented both microglia activation and monocyte recruitment. Inhibition of this neuroinflammatory activation in turn prevented impairments in spatial memory after RSD but did not prevent deficits in neurogenesis nor did it prevent the persistence of social avoidance behavior. These findings show that neuroinflammatory activation after psychosocial stress impairs spatial memory performance independent of deficits in neurogenesis and social avoidance. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Repeated exposure to stress alters the homeostatic environment of the brain, giving rise to various cognitive and mood disorders that impair everyday functioning and overall quality of life. The brain, previously thought of as an immune-privileged organ, is now known to communicate extensively with the peripheral immune system. This brain-body communication plays a significant role in various stress-induced inflammatory conditions, also characterized by psychological impairments. Findings from this study implicate neuroimmune activation rather than impaired neurogenesis in stress-induced cognitive deficits. This idea opens up possibilities for novel immune interventions in the treatment of cognitive and mood disturbances, while also adding to the complexity surrounding the functional implications of adult neurogenesis.},

abstract = {One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of the {\~{}}4 kDa amyloid $\beta$ protein (A$\beta$) within lesions known as senile plaques. A$\beta$ is also deposited in the walls of cerebral blood vessels in many cases of AD. A substantial proportion of the A$\beta$ that accumulates in the AD brain is deposited as Amyloid, which is highly insoluble, proteinaceous material with a $\beta$-pleated-sheet conformation and deposited extracellularly in the form of 5-10 nm wide straight fibrils. As $\gamma$-secretase catalyzes the final cleavage that releases the A$\beta$42 or 40 from amyloid $\beta$ -protein precursor (APP), therefore, it is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. $\gamma$-Secretase cleavage is performed by a high molecular weight protein complex containing presenilins (PSs), nicastrin, Aph-1 and Pen-2. Previous studies have demonstrated that the presenilins (PS1 and PS2) are critical components of a large enzyme complex that performs $\gamma$-secretase cleavage.},

abstract = {The defining features of Alzheimer disease (AD) include conspicuous changes in both brain histology and behavior. The AD brain is characterized microscopically by the combined presence of 2 classes of abnormal structures, extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, both of which comprise highly insoluble, densely packed filaments. The soluble building blocks of these structures are amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptides for plaques and tau for tangles. Amyloid-$\beta$ peptides are proteolytic fragments of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein, whereas tau is a brain-specific, axon-enriched microtubule-associated protein. The behavioral symptoms of AD correlate with the accumulation of plaques and tangles, and they are a direct consequence of the damage and destruction of synapses that mediate memory and cognition. Synapse loss can be caused by the failure of live neurons to maintain functional axons and dendrites or by neuron death. During the past dozen years, a steadily accumulating body of evidence has indicated that soluble forms of A$\beta$ and tau work together, independently of their accumulation into plaques and tangles, to drive healthy neurons into the diseased state and that hallmark toxic properties of A$\beta$ require tau. For instance, acute neuron death, delayed neuron death following ectopic cell cycle reentry, and synaptic dysfunction are triggered by soluble, extracellular A$\beta$ species and depend on soluble, cytoplasmic tau. Therefore, A$\beta$ is upstream of tau in AD pathogenesis and triggers the conversion of tau from a normal to a toxic state, but there is also evidence that toxic tau enhances A$\beta$ toxicity via a feedback loop. Because soluble toxic aggregates of both A$\beta$ and tau can self-propagate and spread throughout the brain by prionlike mechanisms, successful therapeutic intervention for AD would benefit from detecting these species before plaques, tangles, and cognitive impairment become evident and from interfering with the destructive biochemical pathways that they initiate.},

Although the spatial and temporal patterning of miRNA expression is tightly controlled, little is known about signals that induce their expression nor mechanisms of their transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, few miRNA targets have been validated experimentally. The miRNA, miR132, was identified through a genome-wide screen as a target of the transcription factor, cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB). miR132 is enriched in neurons and, like many neuronal CREB targets, is highly induced by neurotrophins. Expression of miR132 in cortical neurons induced neurite outgrowth. Conversely, inhibition of miR132 function attenuated neuronal outgrowth. We provide evidence that miR132 regulates neuronal morphogenesis by decreasing levels of the GTPase-activating protein, p250GAP. These data reveal that a CREB-regulated miRNA regulates neuronal morphogenesis by responding to extrinsic trophic cues.},

Inhibition of cholinergic activity during training reduced the acquisition of learned fear behaviors. Circuit mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of cholinergic signaling in the BLA were assessed by in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological recording. Photostimulation of endogenous cholinergic input (1) enhances firing of putative BLA principal neurons through activation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), (2) enhances glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the BLA, and (3) induces LTP of cortical-amygdala circuits.

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD'S) are highly heritable. Consequently, gene discovery promises to help illuminate the pathophysiology of these syndromes, yielding important opportunities for the development of novel treatments and a more nuanced understanding of the natural history of these disorders. Although the underlying genetic architecture of ASD's is not yet known, the literature demonstrates that it is not, writ large, a monogenic disorder with Mendelian inheritance, but rather a group of complex genetic syndromes with risk deriving from genetic variations in multiple genes. The widely accepted “Common Disease-Common Variant” hypothesis predicts that the risk alleles in ASD's and other complex disorders will be common in the general population. However, recent evidence from gene discovery efforts in a wide range of diseases raises important questions regarding the overall applicability of the theory and the extent of its usefulness in explaining individual genetic liability. In contrast, considerable evidence points to the importance of rare alleles both with regard to their value in providing a foothold into the molecular mechanisms of ASD and their overall contribution to the population-wide risk. This chapter reviews the origins of the common versus rare variant debate, highlights recent findings in the field, and addresses the clinical implications of both common and rare variant discoveries.},

We developed a method to globally screen for cell types involved in behavior by integrating brain-wide activity imaging with high-content molecular phenotyping and volume registration at cellular resolution. We used this method (MultiMAP) to record from 22 neuromodulatory cell types in behaving zebrafish during a reaction-time task that reports alertness. We identified multiple monoaminergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic cell types linked to alertness and found that activity in these cell types was mutually correlated during heightened alertness. We next recorded from and controlled homologous neuromodulatory cells in mice; alertness-related cell-type dynamics exhibited striking evolutionary conservation and modulated behavior similarly. These experiments establish a method for unbiased discovery of cellular elements underlying behavior and reveal an evolutionarily conserved set of diverse neuromodulatory systems that collectively govern internal state.},

Recent expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) association studies have provided information on genetic factors associated with gene expression variation. These eQTLs might contribute to phenotype diversity and disease susceptibility, but interpretation is handicapped by low reproducibility of the expression results. To address this issue, we have generated a set of consensus eQTLs by integrating publicly available data for specific human populations and cell types. Overall, we find over 4000 genes that are involved in high-confidence eQTL relationships. To elucidate the role that eQTLs play in human common diseases, we matched the high-confidence eQTLs to a set of 335 disease risk loci identified from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium GWA study and follow-up studies for 7 human complex trait diseases-bipolar disorder (BD), coronary artery disease (CAD), Crohn's disease (CD), hypertension (HT), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

abstract = {5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) is the key enzyme in leukotriene biosynthesis. Leukotrienes are mediators of the innate immune system and inflammatory processes, and they might also be involved in cancer development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important translational regulators and have been shown to be involved in development, differentiation, and cancer. Unraveling the miRNA network is important for understanding the cellular regulation processes. We identified two new miRNAs, miR-19a-3p and miR-125b-5p, regulating 5-LO and confirmed direct interaction by reporter gene assays. Furthermore, we investigated the regulation of 5-LO by these two miRNAs in several cell types. Inhibition of both miRNAs by antagomirs during differentiation of the myeloid cell line Mono Mac 6 led to a significant increase in 5-LO protein expression. Stimulation of human T lymphocytes with PHA resulted in a strong downregulation of 5-LO mRNA expression and in the induction of miR-19a-3p. The inhibition of miR-19a-3p with an antagomir led to a significant increase in 5-LO mRNA expression in T lymphocytes. Taken together, our data reveal that miR-19a-3p and miR-125b-5p target 5-LO in a cell type- and stimulus-specific manner.},

abstract = {Early-life exposure to drugs and alcohol is one of the most preventable causes of developmental, behavioural and learning disorders in children. Thus a significant amount of basic, animal and human research has focused on understanding the behavioural consequences and the associated neural effects of exposure to drugs and alcohol during early brain development. Despite this, much of the previous research that has been done on this topic has used predominantly male subjects or rodents. While many of the findings from these male-specific studies may ultimately apply to females, the purpose of this review is to highlight the research that has also examined sex as a factor and found striking differences between the sexes in their response to early-life opiate and alcohol exposure. Finally, we will also provide a framework for scientists interested in examining sex as a factor in future experiments that specifically examine the consequences of early-life drug and alcohol exposure.},

This demonstrates the enormous scientific and clinical interest in elucidating the biology of a molecule (or rather a large family of molecules), which began now almost 30 years ago with the description of a cytokine able to exert antitumoral effects in mouse models. Although our understanding of the multiple functions of TNF in vivo and of the respective underlying mechanisms at a cellular and molecular level has made enormous progress since then, new aspects are steadily uncovered and it appears that still much needs to be learned before we can conclude that we have a full comprehension of TNF biology. This review shortly covers some general aspects of this fascinating molecule and then concentrates on the molecular mechanisms of TNF signal transduction. In particular, the multiple facets of crosstalk between the various signalling pathways engaged by TNF will be addressed.},

abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) exists in various molecular forms, depending on alternative splicing of its transcripts and association with structural proteins. Tetramers of the 'tailed' variant (AChE(T)), which are anchored in the cell membrane of neurons by the PRiMA (Proline Rich Membrane Anchor) protein, constitute the main form of AChE in the mammalian brain. In the mouse brain, stress and anticholinesterase inhibitors have been reported to induce expression of the unspliced 'readthrough' variant (AChE(R)) mRNA which produces a monomeric form. To generalize this observation, we attempted to quantify AChE(R) and AChE(T) after organophosphate intoxication in the mouse brain and compared the observed effects with those of stress induced by swimming or immobilization; we also analyzed the effects of heat shock and AChE inhibition on neuroblastoma cells. Active AChE molecular forms were characterized by sedimentation and non-denaturing electrophoresis, and AChE transcripts were quantified by real-time PCR. We observed a moderate increase of the AChE(R) transcript in some cases, both in the mouse brain and in neuroblastoma cultures, but we did not detect any increase of the corresponding active enzyme},

@article{Zimmermann2013,
abstract = {AChE enzymatic inhibition is a core focus of pharmacological intervention in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, AChE has also been ascribed non-hydrolytic functions, which seem related to its appearance in various isoforms. Neuronal AChE presents as a tailed form (AChE-T) predominantly found on the neuronal synapse, and a facultatively expressed readthough form (AChE-R), which exerts short to medium-term protective effects. Notably, this latter form is also found in the periphery. While these non-hydrolytic functions of AChE are most controversially discussed, there is evidence for them being additional targets of AChE inhibitors. This review aims to provide clarification as to the role of these AChE splice variants and their interplay with other cholinergic parameters and their being targets of AChE inhibition: AChE-R is particularly involved in the mediation of (anti-)apoptotic events in cholinergic cells, involving adaptation of various cholinergic parameters and a time-dependent link to the expression of neuroprotective factors. The AChE-T C-terminus is central to AChE activity regulation, while isolated AChE-T C-terminal fragments mediate toxic effects via the $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. There is direct evidence for roles of AChE-T and AChE-R in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection, with these roles involving AChE as a key modulator of the cholinergic system: in vivo data further encourages the use of AChE inhibitors in the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions such as AD since effects on both enzymatic activity and the enzyme's non-hydrolytic functions can be postulated. It also suggests that novel AChE inhibitors should enhance protective AChE-R, while avoiding the concomitant up-regulation of AChE-T.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease involves normal cellular aging and chronic cellular stress events, leading to interrelated changes in gene expression and subsequent neurodegeneration. Premature death of cholinergic neurons and the formation of amyloid fibrils separately initiated the cholinergic and amyloid hypotheses of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we present evidence to the fact that these two distinct phenomena both associate with specific changes in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene expression within cholinergic neurons. For example, calcium misregulation promotes aberrant transcription and pro-apoptotic events, as well as AChE-induced modifications in cellular signal cascades. These reciprocally intercept with AChE regulation at the Endoplasmic Reticulum, modifying AChE gene expression, folding and signaling. Altered AChE properties may reflect changes in the enzymatic and/or non-enzymatic features of the multiple AChE splice variants. Under chronic cellular stress, aberrant AChE regulation may thus facilitate apoptotic pathways, promoting plaque formation, cognitive impairments and degeneration of cholinergic nerve cells.},

Development of effective preventive and treatment strategies for late-life dementia relies on a deep understanding of all the processes involved. In the centuries since the Greek philosopher Pythagoras described the inevitable loss of higher cognitive functions with advanced age, various theories regarding the potential culprits have dominated the field, ranging from demonic possession, through 'hardening of blood vessels', to Alzheimer disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that atrophy in the cortex and hippocampus-now considered to be the best determinant of cognitive decline with aging-results from a combination of AD pathology, inflammation, Lewy bodies, and vascular lesions. A specific constellation of genetic and environmental factors (including apolipoprotein E genotype, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, head trauma, systemic illnesses, and obstructive sleep apnea) contributes to late-life brain atrophy and dementia in each individual. Only a small percentage of people beyond the age of 80 years have 'pure AD' or 'pure vascular dementia'. These concepts, formulated as the dynamic polygon hypothesis, have major implications for clinical trials, as any given drug might not be ideal for all elderly people with dementia.},

RESULTS: A little detective work traced the problem to default date format conversions and floating-point format conversions in the very useful Excel program package. The date conversions affect at least 30 gene names; the floating-point conversions affect at least 2,000 if Riken identifiers are included. These conversions are irreversible; the original gene names cannot be recovered.

CONCLUSIONS: Users of Excel for analyses involving gene names should be aware of this problem, which can cause genes, including medically important ones, to be lost from view and which has contaminated even carefully curated public databases. We provide work-arounds and scripts for circumventing the problem.},

abstract = {Objectives: To characterize the incidence of AD among the elderly population of Cache County, UT, noted for its longevity and high response rates; to explore sex differences; and to examine whether AD incidence plateaus or declines in extreme old age. Methods: Using a multistage screening process in 1998 and 1999, and reexamining 122 individuals who had been identified 3 years earlier as cognitively compromised but not demented, the authors found 185 individuals with incident dementia (123 with AD) among 3,308 participants who contributed 10,541 person-years of observation. Adjusting for nonresponse and screening sensitivity, the authors estimated the incidence of dementia and of AD for men and women in 3-year age intervals. Multivariate discrete time survival analysis was used to examine influences of age, sex, education, and genotype at APOE, as well as interactions of these factors. Results: The incidence of both dementia and AD increased almost exponentially until ages 85 to 90, but appeared to decline after age 93 for men and 97 for women. A statistical interaction between age and the presence of two APOE-$\epsilon$4 alleles indicated acceleration in onset of AD with this genotype; the interaction of age and one $\epsilon$4 suggested more modest acceleration. A statistical interaction of sex and age indicated greater incidence of AD in women than in men after age 85. Conclusions: The incidence of AD in the Cache County population increased with advancing age, but then peaked and declined among the extremely old. The presence of APOE-$\epsilon$4 alleles accelerated onset of AD, but did not appreciably alter lifetime incidence apparent over a span of 100 years.},

Among patients with palpable splenomegaly at baseline, 44{\%} and 63{\%}, respectively, achieved nonpalpable spleen measurements at weeks 24 and 144. Clinically meaningful improvements in pruritus, night sweats, and bone pain were observed within 4 weeks of the initiation of therapy and maintained with continued treatment. Ruxolitinib treatment also reduced elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and granulocyte activation. Thrombocytopenia and anemia were the most common adverse events.Thrombocytopenia of grade 3 or anemia of grade 3 (according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,version 3.0) occurred in 3 patients each (9{\%}) (1 patient had both) and were managed with dose modification.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Ruxolitinib was generally well tolerated and provided rapid and durable clinical benefits in patients with advanced PV who were refractory or intolerant to hydroxyurea.},

abstract = {Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)-mediated reprogramming is a rapid, efficient, and sophisticated process that reprograms differentiated somatic cells to a pluripotent state. However, many factors in this elaborate reprogramming process remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the microRNA (miR) miR-125b is an important component of SCNT-mediated reprogramming. Luciferase reporter assay, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting demonstrated that miR-125b directly binds the 3'-untranslated region of SUV39H1, encoding the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SUV39H1, to down-regulate histone H3 lysine-9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) in SCNT embryos. Furthermore, the miR-125b/SUV39H1 interaction induced loss of SUV39H1-mediated H3K9me3, caused heterochromatin relaxation, and promoted the development of SCNT embryos. Transcriptome analyses of SCNT blastomeres indicated that HNF1 homeobox B (HNF1B), a gene encoding a transcription factor downstream of and controlled by the miR-125b/SUV39H1 axis, is important for conferring developmental competence on preimplantation embryos. We conclude that miR-125b promotes SCNT-mediated nuclear reprogramming by targeting SUV39H1 to decrease the deposition of repressive H3K9me3 modifications.},

abstract = {Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is the most extensively studied member of the cytokine family that signal through intracellular chains of the gp130/LIFR$\beta$ receptor. The severe phenotype in patients suffering from mutations inactivating LIFR$\beta$ indicates that members of this cytokine family play key, non-redundant roles during development. Accordingly, three decades of research has revealed potent and promising trophic and regulatory activities of CNTF in neurons, oligodendrocytes, muscle cells, bone cells, adipocytes and retinal cells. These findings led to clinical trials to test the therapeutic potential of CNTF and CNTF derivatives for treating neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases. Promising results have encouraged continuation of studies for treating retinal degenerative diseases. Results of some clinical trials showed that side-effects may limit the systemically administrated doses of CNTF. Therefore, therapies being currently tested rely on local delivery of CNTF using encapsulated cytokine-secreting implants. Since the side effects of CNTF might be linked to its ability to activate the alternative IL6R$\alpha$-LIFR$\beta$-gp130 receptor, CNTFR-specific mutants of CNTF have been developed that bind to the CNTFR$\alpha$-LIFR$\beta$-gp130 receptor. These developments may prove to be a breakthrough for therapeutic applications of systemically administered CNTF in pathologies such as multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease. The “designer cytokine approach” offers future opportunities to further enhance specificity by conjugating mutant CNTF with modified soluble CNTFR$\alpha$ to target therapeutically relevant cells that express gp130-LIFR$\beta$ and a specific cell surface marker.},

Local delivery method such as Convection-Enhanced Delivery (CED) has been introduced to avoid this recurrence by delivering active molecules via positive-pressure methods. For an efficient infusion, the distribution volume of the drug has to be optimized while avoiding backflow, since this is responsible for side effects and a reduction of therapeutic efficacy. The encapsulation of the drug infused in nanosized structures can be considered, which would lead to a reduction of both toxicity of the treatment and infusion time during CED. In the present review, we will firstly discuss the technical approach of CED with regard to catheter design and brain characteristics; secondly, we will describe the 'ideal' nanocarrier in terms of size, surface properties, and interaction with the extracellular matrix for optimal diffusion in the brain parenchyma. We also discuss preclinical and clinical applications of this new method.},

IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin (Epo) elevated choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in septal cholinergic cell line SN6 as well as in primary cultured septal neurons without increasing protein contents of the cells. These effects were dose-dependent and the optimal doses were not different from those for blood cells. IL-3 had neurite-promoting activity but GM-CSF had no such effect. Both IL-3 and GM-CSF decreased intracellular acetylcholine concentration, and elevated glutamic acid decarboxylase and intracellular GABA in septal neuronal cultures. Epo elevated monoamines in PC12 cells. These effects are thought to result from direct action through their specific receptors in neurons, because (i) anti-IL-3-receptor antibody abolished the ChAT activity in septal neurons increased by IL-3; (ii) mRNA and immunoreactivity for beta subunits of IL-3 receptors were expressed in septal cholinergic neurons and (iii) presence of receptors for GM-CSF and Epo in neurons has been reported. Our observation and others strongly support that neural-immune interactions are important not only in the defense mechanism in the nervous system but also in the development, differentiation and function of neurons.},

Here we show that the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons of monozygotic twins from pairs discordant for schizophrenia enhances disease-specific signal by minimizing genetic heterogeneity. In proteomic and pathway analyses, clinical illness is associated especially with altered glycosaminoglycan, GABAergic synapse, sialylation, and purine metabolism pathways. Although only 12{\%} of all 19,462 genes are expressed differentially between healthy males and females, up to 61{\%} of the illness-related genes are sex specific. These results on sex-specific genes are replicated in another dataset. This implies that the pathophysiology differs between males and females, and may explain why symptoms appear after adolescence when the expression of many sex-specific genes change, and suggests the need for sex-specific treatments.},

abstract = {Background: Sp100 is a permanent ProMyelocytic Leukaemian nuclear bodies (PML NB)-associated protein, and has been reported to participate in the regulation of transcriptional activity, apoptosis and other cellular biological processes. The aim of the present study was to explore the expression of Sp100 and its potential clinical implications in laryngeal cancer. Material/Methods: The mRNA and protein levels of Sp100 in 96 laryngeal cancer samples and paired normal epithelium were examined by RT-PCR, Western blot and immuno-histochemical staining. The correlation of Sp100 expression with clinicopathological features of these patients was assessed by Chisquared test. Results: The coherent low Sp100 expression of both transcriptional and translational levels were confirmed in the malignant tissues compared to the normal mucosa, and the expression was down-regulated among the well-, moderately- and poorly-differentiated cancer cells accordingly. Moreover, immuno- histochemical staining demonstrated that Sp100 showed a predominantly nuclear pattern in well-differentiated cancer cells, and diffuse cellular distribution in cytoplasm in poorly-differentiated cancer cells. Besides histological type of cancer cells, other clinicopathological characteristics, including age, sex, T classification, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and clinical stage, showed no significant correlation with Sp100 low expression. Conclusions: Our finding provides an important clue to further understanding the role of Sp100 in the initiation and progression of tumorgenesis. {\textcopyright} Med Sci Monit, 2010.},

abstract = {The intestinal tissue notably responds to stressful, cholinergic and innate immune signals by microRNA (miRNA) changes, but whether and how those miRNA regulators modify the intestinal cholinergic and innate immune pathways remained unexplored. Here, we report changes in several miRNA regulators of cholinesterases (ChEs) and correspondingly modified ChE activities in intestine, splenocytes and the circulation of mice exposed to both stress and canonical or alternative Toll-Like Receptor 9 (TLR9) oligonucleotide (ODN) aptamer activators or blockers. Stressful intraperitoneal injection of saline, the anti-inflammatory TLR9 agonist mEN101 aptamer or the inflammation-activating TLR9 aptamer ODN 1826 all increased the expression of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting miR-132. In comparison, mEN101 but neither ODN 1826 nor saline injections elevated intestinal miR-129-5p, miR-186 and miR-200c, all predicted to target both AChE and the homologous enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). In cultured immune cells, BL-7040, the human counterpart of mEN101, reduced AChE activity reflecting inflammatory reactions in a manner preventable by the TLR9 blocking ODN 2088. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory BL-7040 TLR9 aptamer caused reduction in nitric oxide and AChE activity in both murine splenocytes and human mononuclear cells at molar concentrations four orders of magnitude lower than ODN 1826. Our findings demonstrate differential reaction of cholinesterase-targeting miRNAs to distinct TLR9 challenges, indicating upstream miRNA co-regulation of the intestinal alternative NF??B pathway and cholinergic signaling. TLR9 aptamers may hence potentiate miRNA regulation that enhances cholinergic signaling and the resolution of inflammation, which opens new venues for manipulating bowel diseases.},

abstract = {Among other factors, changes in gene expression on the human evolutionary lineage have been suggested to play an important role in the establishment of human-specific phenotypes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these expression changes are largely unknown. Here, we have explored the role of microRNA (miRNA) in the regulation of gene expression divergence among adult humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques, in two brain regions: prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. Using a combination of high-throughput sequencing, miRNA microarrays, and Q-PCR, we have shown that up to 11{\%} of the 325 expressed miRNA diverged significantly between humans and chimpanzees and up to 31{\%} between humans and macaques. Measuring mRNA and protein expression in human and chimpanzee brains, we found a significant inverse relationship between the miRNA and the target genes expression divergence, explaining 2{\%}-4{\%} of mRNA and 4{\%}-6{\%} of protein expression differences. Notably, miRNA showing human-specific expression localize in neurons and target genes that are involved in neural functions. Enrichment in neural functions, as well as miRNA-driven regulation on the human evolutionary lineage, was further confirmed by experimental validation of predicted miRNA targets in two neuroblastoma cell lines. Finally, we identified a signature of positive selection in the upstream region of one of the five miRNA with human-specific expression, miR-34c-5p. This suggests that miR-34c-5p expression change took place after the split of the human and the Neanderthal lineages and had adaptive significance. Taken together these results indicate that changes in miRNA expression might have contributed to evolution of human cognitive functions.},

abstract = {Mushroom bodies are a well-known site for associative learning in insects. Yet the precise mechanisms that underlie plasticity there and ensure their specificity remain elusive. In locusts, the synapses between the intrinsic mushroom body neurons and their postsynaptic targets obey a Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule. Although this property homeostatically regulates the timing of mushroom body output, its potential role in associative learning is unknown. Here we show in vivo that pre-post pairing causing STDP can, when followed by the local delivery of a reinforcement-mediating neuromodulator, specify the synapses that will undergo an associative change. At these synapses, and there only, the change is a transformation of the STDP rule itself. These results illustrate the multiple actions of STDP, including a role in associative learning, despite potential temporal dissociation between the pairings that specify synaptic modification and the delivery of reinforcement-mediating neuromodulator signals.},

abstract = {Cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia (SCZ) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major driver of functional disability but is largely unresponsive to current therapeutics. Animal models of cognitive dysfunction relevant to both disorders suggest the $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) may be a promising drug development target, with multiple clinical trials subsequently testing this hypothesis in individuals with SCZ and AD. However, the translational value of rodent cognitive tasks for predicting the overall efficacy of this therapeutic target in clinical trials is unknown. To compare effect sizes between rodent and human studies, we searched PubMed and the Cochrane Library for all randomized, placebo-controlled trials of compounds with pharmacological activity at the $\alpha$7 nAChR for treatment of cognitive dysfunction in SCZ and AD and identified 18 studies comprising 2670 subjects treated with eight different compounds acting as full or partial agonists. Cognitive outcomes were standardized, and random-effects meta-analyses revealed no statistically significant effects of $\alpha$7 nAChR agonists on overall cognition or any of eight cognitive subdomains when all doses were included (Range of all cognitive outcomes: Cohen's d=-0.077 to 0.12, negative favoring drug). In contrast, analysis of 29 rodent studies testing the same $\alpha$7 agonists revealed large effect sizes in multiple commonly used preclinical behavioral tests of cognition (Range: d=-1.18 to - 0.73). Our results suggest that targeting the $\alpha$7 nAChR with agonists is not a robust treatment for cognitive dysfunction in SCZ or AD and necessitate a better understanding of the translational gap for therapeutics targeting the $\alpha$7 nAChR.},

abstract = {Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a monocyte-specific chemoattractant and activator and is a member of the chemokine-beta family of cytokines. To identify regions of MCP-1 which are required for its biological activity, we constructed human MCP-1 mutants that were expressed in eukaryotic cells and tested for their ability to attract monocytes in vitro. Deletion of amino acids 2-8 destroyed activity, suggesting that the amino-terminal region is necessary for activity. Within the deleted region, mutation of aspartate 3 to alanine produced a protein with 9{\%} of wild-type activity, whereas mutation of asparagine 6 to alanine produced a protein with 52.9{\%} of wild-type activity. Mutation of amino acids within the first intercysteine loop yielded variable results. Changing tyrosine 28 to aspartate or arginine 30 to leucine each produced proteins with essentially no monocyte chemoattractant activity. The side chains of these amino acids are predicted to point into a putative receptor binding cleft, and these loss-of-function mutations are consistent with this model. Also consistent is the retention of 60{\%} of wild-type activity after mutation of serine 27 to glutamine, since the side chain of serine 27 is predicted to point away from the binding cleft. However, mutation of arginine 24, which lies outside of this area, to phenylalanine produced a protein with only 5{\%} of wild-type activity, suggesting more complex interactions. Truncations of the carboxyl terminus, as well as mutation of aspartate 68 to leucine, generated proteins with 10-20{\%} of wild-type activity. (Another carboxyl-terminal insertional mutation demonstrated that O-linked carbohydrate in MCP-1 alpha may be added to a threonine in the carboxyl-terminal region.) These findings are consistent with a structural model of dimeric MCP-1 which is similar to interleukin-8, in which amino acids that point into a cleft between the two carboxyl-terminal alpha-helices of the subunits are important for receptor binding. In addition, however, amino acids at the amino terminus and others outside of the interhelical cleft are also essential for activity. The carboxyl-terminal alpha-helix is not required for signaling per se but is required for maximal specific activity. Finally, four mutant proteins partially inhibited the ability of wild-type MCP-1 to attract monocytes in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND tRFs, 14 to 32 nt long single-stranded RNA derived from mature or precursor tRNAs, are a recently discovered class of small RNA that have been found to be present in diverse organisms at read counts comparable to miRNAs. Currently, there is a debate about their biogenesis and function. RESULTS This is the first meta-analysis of tRFs. Analysis of more than 50 short RNA libraries has revealed that tRFs are precisely generated fragments present in all domains of life (bacteria to humans), and are not produced by the miRNA biogenesis pathway. Human PAR-CLIP data shows a striking preference for tRF-5s and tRF-3s to associate with AGO1, 3 and 4 rather than AGO2, and analysis of positional T to C mutational frequency indicates these tRFs associate with Argonautes in a manner similar to miRNAs. The reverse complements of canonical seed positions in these sequences match cross-link centered regions, suggesting these tRF-5s and tRF-3s interact with RNAs in the cell. Consistent with these results, human AGO1 CLASH data contains thousands of tRF-5 and tRF-3 reads chimeric with mRNAs. CONCLUSIONS tRFs are an abundant class of small RNA present in all domains of life whose biogenesis is distinct from miRNAs. In human HEK293 cells tRFs associate with Argonautes 1, 3 and 4 and not Argonaute 2 which is the main effector protein of miRNA function, but otherwise have very similar properties to miRNAs, indicating tRFs may play a major role in RNA silencing.},

abstract = {Competition between mammalian RNAi-related gene silencing pathways is well documented. It is therefore important to identify all classes of small RNAs to determine their relationship with RNAi and how they affect each other functionally. Here, we identify two types of 5'-phosphate, 3'-hydroxylated human tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). tsRNAs differ from microRNAs in being essentially restricted to the cytoplasm and in associating with Argonaute proteins, but not MOV10. The first type belongs to a previously predicted Dicer-dependent class of small RNAs that we find can modestly down-regulate target genes in trans. The 5' end of type II tsRNA was generated by RNaseZ cleavage downstream from a tRNA gene, while the 3' end resulted from transcription termination by RNA polymerase III. Consistent with their preferential association with the nonslicing Argonautes 3 and 4, canonical gene silencing activity was not observed for type II tsRNAs. The addition, however, of an oligonucleotide that was sense to the reporter gene, but antisense to an overexpressed version of the type II tsRNA, triggered robust, {\textgreater}80{\%} gene silencing. This correlated with the redirection of the thus reconstituted fully duplexed double-stranded RNA into Argonaute 2, whereas Argonautes 3 and 4 were skewed toward less structured small RNAs, particularly single-strand RNAs. We observed that the modulation of tsRNA levels had minor effects on the abundance of microRNAs, but more pronounced changes in the silencing activities of both microRNAs and siRNAs. These findings support that tsRNAs are involved in the global control of small RNA silencing through differential Argonaute association, suggesting that small RNA-mediated gene regulation may be even more finely regulated than previously realized.},

abstract = {Upon exposure to stress, tRNAs are enzymatically cleaved, yielding distinct classes of tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs). We identify a novel class of tRFs derived from tRNAGlu, tRNAAsp, tRNAGly, and tRNATyr that, upon induction, suppress the stability of multiple oncogenic transcripts in breast cancer cells by displacing their 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) from the RNA-binding protein YBX1. This mode of post-transcriptional silencing is sequence specific, as these fragments all share a common motif that matches the YBX1 recognition sequence. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies, using anti-sense locked-nucleic acids (LNAs) and synthetic RNA mimetics, respectively, revealed that these fragments suppress growth under serum-starvation, cancer cell invasion, and metastasis by breast cancer cells. Highly metastatic cells evade this tumor-suppressive pathway by attenuating the induction of these tRFs. Our findings reveal a tumor-suppressive role for specific tRNA-derived fragments and describe a molecular mechanism for their action. This transcript displacement-based mechanism may generalize to other tRNA, ribosomal-RNA, and sno-RNA fragments.},

EEG monitoring of patients with focal epilepsy identified significant
differences in 3 tRNA fragments (5'GlyGCC, 5'AlaTGC, and 5'GluCTC)

fragments were higher in pre-seizure than in post-seizure samples,
suggesting that they may serve as biomarkers of seizure risk in patients

extracellular release of tRNA fragments were lower after
epileptiform-like activity in hippocampal neurons. We designed PCR-based
assays to quantify tRNA fragments in a cohort of pre- and post-seizure
plasma samples from patients with focal epilepsy and from healthy

fragments potently distinguished pre- from post-seizure patients.
Elevated levels of tRNA fragments were not detected in patients with

Fragmentation of RNA molecules of basically all functional classes has been reported to yield smaller non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that typically possess different roles compared with their parental transcripts. Here we show that a valine tRNA-derived fragment (Val-tRF) that is produced under certain stress conditions in the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii is capable of binding to the small ribosomal subunit. As a consequence of Val-tRF binding mRNA is displaced from the initiation complex which results in global translation attenuation in vivo and in vitro. The fact that the archaeal Val-tRF also inhibits eukaryal as well as bacterial protein biosynthesis implies a functionally conserved mode of action. While tRFs and tRNA halves have been amply identified in recent RNA-seq project, Val-tRF described herein represents one of the first functionally characterized tRNA processing products to date.},

@article{Yamasaki2009,
abstract = {Stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2$\alpha$ inhibits global protein synthesis to conserve energy for repair of stress-induced damage. Stress-induced translational arrest is observed in cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable eIF2$\alpha$ mutant (S51A), which indicates the existence of an alternative pathway of translational control. In this paper, we show that arsenite, heat shock, or ultraviolet irradiation promotes transfer RNA (tRNA) cleavage and accumulation of tRNA-derived, stress-induced small RNAs (tiRNAs). We show that angiogenin, a secreted ribonuclease, is required for stress-induced production of tiRNAs. Knockdown of angiogenin, but not related ribonucleases, inhibits arsenite-induced tiRNA production and translational arrest. In contrast, knockdown of the angiogenin inhibitor RNH1 enhances tiRNA production and promotes arsenite-induced translational arrest. Moreover, recombinant angiogenin, but not RNase 4 or RNase A, induces tiRNA production and inhibits protein synthesis in the absence of exogenous stress. Finally, transfection of angiogenin-induced tiRNAs promotes phospho-eIF2$\alpha$–independent translational arrest. Our results introduce angiogenin and tiRNAs as components of a phospho-eIF2$\alpha$–independent stress response program.},

abstract = {Noncoding small RNAs arise from the various un-annotated and annotated regions of the genome. When they arise from annotated genes, the noncoding small RNAs are functionally different from the parent genes. This is a brief review of one class of noncoding small RNAs, tRNA-related fragments (tRFs), which are generated from tRNA. tRFs have been suggested to have roles in cell proliferation, priming of viral reverse transcriptases, regulation of gene expression, RNA processing, modulation of the DNA damage response, tumor suppression, and neurodegeneration.},

@article{Maute2013,
abstract = {Sequencing studies from several model systems have suggested that diverse and abundant small RNAs may be derived from tRNA, but the function of these molecules remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that one such tRNA-derived fragment, cloned from human mature B cells and designated CU1276, in fact possesses the functional characteristics of a microRNA, including a DICER1-dependent biogenesis, physical association with Argonaute proteins, and the ability to repress mRNA transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. Expression of CU1276 is abundant in normal germinal center B cells but absent in germinal center-derived lymphomas, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Furthermore, CU1276 represses endogenous RPA1, an essential gene involved in many aspects of DNA dynamics, and consequently, expression of this tRNA-derived microRNA in a lymphoma cell line suppresses proliferation and modulates the molecular response to DNA damage. These results establish that functionally active microRNAs can be derived from tRNA, thus defining a class of genetic entities with potentially important biological roles.},

@article{Honda2015,
abstract = {Sex hormones and their receptors play critical roles in the development and progression of the breast and prostate cancers. Here we report that a novel type of transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived small RNA, termed Sex HOrmone-dependent TRNA-derived RNAs (SHOT-RNAs), are specifically and abundantly expressed in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer and androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer cell lines. SHOT-RNAs are not abundantly present in ER(-) breast cancer, AR(-) prostate cancer, or other examined cancer cell lines from other tissues. ER-dependent accumulation of SHOT-RNAs is not limited to a cell culture system, but it also occurs in luminal-type breast cancer patient tissues. SHOT-RNAs are produced from aminoacylated mature tRNAs by angiogenin-mediated anticodon cleavage, which is promoted by sex hormones and their receptors. Resultant 5'- and 3'-SHOT-RNAs, corresponding to 5'- and 3'-tRNA halves, bear a cyclic phosphate (cP) and an amino acid at the 3'-end, respectively. By devising a "cP-RNA-seq" method that is able to exclusively amplify and sequence cP-containing RNAs, we identified the complete repertoire of 5'-SHOT-RNAs. Furthermore, 5'-SHOT-RNA, but not 3'-SHOT-RNA, has significant functional involvement in cell proliferation. These results have unveiled a novel tRNA-engaged pathway in tumorigenesis of hormone-dependent cancers and implicate SHOT-RNAs as potential candidates for biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},
