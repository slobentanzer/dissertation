%As a scientist, I am not only standing on the shoulders of figurative giants, but also on the shoulders of very real persons, without whom this dissertation would not have been possible. As such, I consider it an honour and a privilege to be in the position to give thanks to everybody who helped me along the way. I want to thank my parents, for always allowing me to follow my intuitions, and for providing me with a strong sense of reality and morals; and my brother, for always testing and enforcing these principles. I want to thank Betti, for listening, and for her valuable feedback and support; and Alex and Misel, for distractions and for being the friends that they are. Tobi and Christian, for giving me balance with music, physical activity, and consumption of alcoholic beverages; and Frauke and Eunhye, for essentially the same, just more music and less of the other things.
